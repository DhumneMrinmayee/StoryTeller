**"Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei, these childhood games are unbecoming of a proper young riftmaw."** Tav-nel-du-nerocan, Dragon of Force, coiled around the small stone house that her son and his friends were using as a table.

"Moooooom! Don't call me a *dragon* name while I'm playing! While I'm at the table, my name is *Jake.*"

Tav-nel-du-nerocan snorted with disgust, and a ripple of repulsive force rattled around the little dolls her son was playing with on the top of the flat, square house. "This is exactly why you can't be seen playing these... household games," she said. "I heard that roleplaying games stop violence, you know."

"Oh, come on, Mom! Just because I like to *pretend* to be a human doesn't mean that I'll suddenly stop being violent. That's just something the other moms like to say about household games because they don't have anything better to do with their lives." Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei's friends nodded sagely.

Tav-nel-du-nerocan grunted, disappointed. "See? You're already becoming soft, like those humans. A *proper* riftmaw would have tackled me as soon as I'd even insinuated you were losing your edge."

"Er... right. Rawr. You've insulted me for the last time, Lily. Roll for initiative!" Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei picked up a rock and halfheartedly tossed it at his mother.

The sheer, repulsive force of his mother's disgust blew the rock away before it ever made contact. "I'll tell you what, Ekrikri-sam-touklvei," his mother said. "How about you can keep playing—*if* you let me play too? And we'll make it a *proper* game, for *real* dragons."

The group of young dragons gathered around the stone house shared uncertain glances. "Well... it beats going on another practice raid," the Office Master said. "I'm sick of Odin telling me what to do."

Tav-nel-du-nerocan's smile was full of teeth and not much else. "Excellent," she said. "Of course, *I* will be the Dungeon Master from now on." She swept the dolls off the rooftop, then reached one claw inside the house—with a scream and a *snap*, she withdrew four... replacements.

"Where were you?" Tav-nel-du-nerocan mused, to the horror of the four young dragons. "Ah, yes. You were en route to executing the sixty-sixth order against the filthy plague of humans. Do cheer up, kids. We're going to have some *fun.*"
