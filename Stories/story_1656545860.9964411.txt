Gushing fire glances air

Crow was here, now is there

With a tiny round of gold 

Clenched in beak, this old

Foul bird has seen a lot

And a tiny dragon pup is not

Enough to sway his old fowl soul.


Blue sky drifts innocently

Between the bird who’s feathers seem

To bring the night back into day,

To spite the scaly infants play

Who’s purple scales reflect the shine

Of the sun even if rain blinds;

This youthful beast will have its way.


Smoke curls up from the grinning mouth

That opens to burn the world down,

But let’s out a shout as coin comes quick,

Lest he melt its shine to a puddle of ick

He readies to snatch, but his jaw only drops

As the crow, from behind, runs and hops,

Snatches gold from before slitted eyes,

And flaps away, but let’s out a cry,

As caught by purple maw, leg of crow

Drags night to the ground,

Then in the dirt is dragged around

As dragon grins the crow laughs loud,

And the scaly beast, confused but proud

Hears the rumbling far too late,

As wagon wheel almost ends his fate,

He lets go of the crow who gets the hell out of dodge,

As still in its beak, firmly lodged,

The gold reflects the dragons eyes

Underneath wagon-darkened skies.
