[Poem]

The army grows.

From two to three and three to four, 

celebrating door to door, 

The Army grows evermore.

It started at the age of two

It was just me and you

And then it was Timmy too

And eventually Connie and Pooh.

But the army didn’t stop at four,

because celebrating from door to door,

Old and young, rich and poor,

The army grows evermore.

Eventually it was Billy and others I forgot.

We added so many candles the entire room got hot.

So much food to cook, pots and pots and pots

Of chicken and salad and tomato stew and even tatertots. 

But we don’t mind the endless chores 

Or more expensive visits to party stores 

Because the one thing that is for sure

Is that our Army grows evermore. 

We are know as the “Legion of June”

And we will take over soon.

Immortality is the boon

We pick, wishing on moons

And shooting stars and the Planet Mars

As we gobble cake and ice cream bars,

For…

From Palm Beach to Russian shores

Whether you’re a doctor, fireman, pilot or whore

Or live at the Earth’s core,

The Army grows forevermore.
