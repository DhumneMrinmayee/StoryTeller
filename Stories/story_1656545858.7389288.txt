David asked his friends, "So tell me, what was your perfect shot."

Phil the photographer said, "That would have to be a topless redhead with green eyes I got on my first trip to Ireland. She would be hard to beat. If I'd left it at that, I'd be better off. She turned out to be my first wife and worst divorce. Caine, what would be your perfect shot?"

Caine swirled his Scotch on the rocks and took a sip contemplating his answer. After due deliberation, he said, "I got a Taliban Mufti at a thousand meters with a Barrett fifty. Took his head clean off. David, what is your perfect shot?"

David swirled the fiery silver liquid in his glass and said, "My perfect shot will never abandon me or seek revenge."

Caine asked again irritably, "Well, what is it."

David downed the shot, placed the shot glass on the table with a thump, and answered, "Chilled vodka with a lemon twist."
