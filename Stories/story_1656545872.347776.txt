Th-thus can't be right. There must have been a mistake. 

"What is it now? I was in the middle of an importiant buisness meeting."

I grabbed the book from the younger acolyte and glanced over the page that gave the most accurate picture to date of our dark God, Devrou. It was practically a black mass of pure nothingness that consumed everything it touched. The pure embodiment of destruction. 

What stood before us was a man in a business suit.

"Well? Speak up!" The man enquired. His dark red eyes moving around the room at each of us. "You're wasting my time."

The figure lifted a hand and suddenly I was pulled by some invisible force till I was hovering in midair a few feet off the ground in front of this stranger. Paralyzed, and unable to move.

"Give me that." The man took the book from my grasp and looked the page I had it open to. His eyes widening a bit in surprise. 

"Unhand that book, blaspher!" An acolyte demanded, temporarily getting the attention of the businessman. "That book is of our dark God! You are unworthy of gazing at his mere image!"

"Is that so?" The figure mused as he closed the book loudly. "Then let me be the last."

The book suddenly erupted into flames and disappeared into ash in mere seconds. A stunned silence filled the room. "Wasn't very good reading material anyway." 

The figure looked at me like he just remembered I was there. Suddenly, I dropped to the floor in a heap and scrambled up to get my bearings. "You can go," the figure uttered dispassionately.

"W-who are you?" I asked, using every ounce of courage I could muster. Whoever this is, he may not be our god, but he's powerful enough to be unconcerned about being in a room full of fanatical warriors. I had to force myself to stop shaking from fear. 

"Oh my, where are my manners?" The figure bowed, "I am Lucien," A pair of swords appeared in his hands. " And I am the one who defeated Devrou."
