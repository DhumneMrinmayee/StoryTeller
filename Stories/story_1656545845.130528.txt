Chuckling, he let me walk away.  

I scuttled to the cellar, where Dani was waiting for me. He rubbed his hands together slowly, a gesture of pity. “I wish you’d let me know,” he muttered. “I could have told you that wouldn’t work.”  

I lay on the floor with a grunt. “I don’t understand. That toxin would have killed anything.” 

Dani looked up. “Not quite, Jen.”  

“Yes, quite,” I insisted. “I used the Father of Death. It kills any living thing in the world.” 

My friend slapped at his back. “Would you *listen?* The King is not like anything else in the world. You don’t take things for granted. Which is why - I return to my original point - you should have told me. I work for him, remember? He drinks that stuff every day. In quantities several times greater than that puny dose you slipped in his juice.”  

I stared. “He drinks poison? Why…?”  

The other alien shrugged. “He calls it whiskey. Don't ask me why he drinks it. Humans are weird.”
