"What wisdom today, oh great one?"

"Welp... Uh, seems that rain is coming tomorrow... Yep, I'd say the crops need some of that around this time."

The group of questioning, black-robed acolytes quickly jotted down every word the overall wearing farmer said, even the cadence in which he said it with. They obviously knew that rain was coming, anybody with any hint of celestial sensing could accomplish such an amateur task, but they were beginning to understand that their master was... *Different.* 

"Say, is that another shiny?" The farmer asked to no one in particular, rubbing the sweat off of his head and looking at a armor wearing man approaching his gate. "Seven damnations." 

The acolytes wanted to follow, but they knew that a paladin would probably take less kindly to them than they do the farmers dragon. "Say," The farmer yelled to them as he was walking away towards the visitor. "'Ya'll better make sure that the corn is planted and weeded before I get back. Can't be missing the first good rain." Unsure of what else to do, and still trying to decipher the new dark lord, they obeyed.

"Say sonny!" The farmer laid down his hoe by the front gate and extended a welcoming hand to the man in shining silver armor. "Welcome to Pepperidge farms. The name is Jobe Pepperidge, but you can call me Joe, or Dark Lord like those strange boys in hoods do."

"What did you ju--"

"Now," The farmer put up his leathery, worn hand to pause the paladin. "I need to make something clear. All strangers are welcome on the farm. If it's work or just a good bed that you're looking for, you'll find it here, but I got two rules on this here farm."

"...Okay."

"Be kind to each other, and don't, under any circumstances, touch Bessy."

The paladin paused, his handsome, chiseled face practically gleamed as bright as his armor, and his short golden locks curled around his forehead like small curtains. "Wait..." He looked both ways, as if he was missing the joke. "You're... The dark lord?"

The farmer snorted out a chuckle, "Well. I'm not one for nicknames, again Joe is as far as I usually go, but if that's what you wanna call me... Well I suppose I have no right to tell another man what to do, now do I?"

"No... I, uhh, guess you don't."

The farmer smiled another warm smile and patted the paladin on his shoulder. "Now boy, what you say your name was again?"

"It's, um." The paladin coughed and glanced down at his helmet and battlesword. *Was this really him?* "It's Raylor."

The farmer let out a high pitched whistle, "Fancy name, must be from those royal regions. Anyways Raylor, let's get you inside and fed, I bet the road was quite tough."

As soon as Raylor entered the rather large manor house that the farmer lived in, he gasped at the sight of dozens of women children and men inside, all working at different tasks and labors.

"Yep," The farmer said with a broad smile. "You could really say that the divines have blessed me with good company. Riya, could you get this starving boy some good food?"

Raylor was stunned at seeing a gremlin standing on a stool beside the kitchen, dicing up fruits and veggies as it barley cast a glance toward him. *My god,* he thought, *Those things are banned from living in any of the central provinces! Why would he have one he--*

"Sure thing Joe! Would be happy too." Before Raylor could understand what was happening, the thing had dragged him to a table and was stuffing his face with good ole fashion farming food. *Maybe... Maybe this wasn't such a bad place after all?*

Ole Farmer Joe left the boy in the house, he always thought that the youth enjoyed each others company much more than some ole coot like himself. He walked around one of the large hills on his property and found sitting under an abandon farmhouse -- his pride and joy. 

"There's ole bessy!" He yelled out with a smile.

The little dragon had already grown from the size of a lizard to the size two wagons lined back-to-back! It pounced over towards the old farmer with playful, loving eyes, shacking the ground with each monstrous hop but delicately halting and laying its head down as soon as it reached the small old man.

Ole Joe rubbed the dragon affectionately, talking to it soothingly like he usually does around this time of day. He had originally started talking to the dragon because he thought the young thing seemed scared and anxious, and that a loving voice would help calm it, but as it grew up ole Joe realized that he needed it just as much as the dragon did.

"More people are arriving everyday Bessy. It's getting real crazy and crowded over there, I tell ya, but don't worry, not a soul touching you." Ole Joe looked up toward the setting evening sky. "Not a soul touching anybody on this farm, not with my say, we protect our own, and my own is anybody with a heart big enough to care for another."

Ole Joe could begin to hear the clamor that was most of the acolytes and paladins returning in from their fields. "Some call me the dark lord Bessy... Well, if that's what they call someone who cares, I guess I'm the darkest fella there is..."
