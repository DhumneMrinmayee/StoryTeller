(quick sidenote, this is one of the best things that i have ever been given)

He was on the verge of death. Even in his many decades of saving the town. The people around him were booing him. “listen here, you ungrateful brats” the demonic voice that carried that message echoed throughout the street. Everyone stopped. Everyone stopped booing. Nobody was expecting this to happen, it took everyone a second to register what happened. “are you seriously booing the man that is putting his life on the line to protect your pathetic life? Do you seriously hate him that much that you are entertained by the prospect of his death?” this time the voice was even stronger. It bellowed throughout the entire town. The echo it caused was almost deadly.   
“b-b-but he’s a vampire” said one of the people there, barely able to form a coherent sentence  
“Who cares what he is? Don’t you think it kills him, knowing that he has to do this job and just be hates because of what he is?” every time it spoke, it got louder. “he could easily snap and switch sides. With the power he has, you would be in real danger!”  
“but he’s the spawn of evil” someone else responded, before being abruptly cut off  
“I’m also the spawn of evil, more so than him but you seem to want me to kill him.”  
Everyone thought about it. “he couldn’t even kill you with his so called ‘power’ could he”. That was all that came from the crowd, it was barely audible. They were all clearly terrified  
The demon moved its hand, exposing multiple stab wounds on its body “he has killed me, several times. And this is the latest.” It announced, with a trembling voice before it dropped dead.  
There was a collective gasp from the crowd, before shouts of praise.   
The hero was just stood there, trying to process what the hell had just happened.
