They laughed at your power, quite literally infact, for your powers were just that making people laugh. It had been a handy power at times making people laugh just enough so they forget about the little misgivings they had about you, or the few times you were caught in a bad position. Well for your part you were content having, plus having become a stand up comic, things were easy.

And well, for the occasional troublesome person, you could just help them become a bit more jolly, laughing at things, just enough that it becomes a bit tougher to breathe, and a little more and then more. And before you know it, they are no longer being troublesome.

"Laugh at me, laugh till the end."
