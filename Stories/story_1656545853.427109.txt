Why am I actively improving the human quality of life?  Why am I actively preventing their destruction by the hostile factions of this galaxy?  How short-sighted you are.

It's simple.  I want humans to die.  I want to watch, to savor, the deaths of as many humans as possible.  How can I do that if they're extinct?  I'm going to be here until the universe grows dim.  I do not grow bored.  I do not grow impatient.  There is no difference between a human dying now or dying in 100 years.  None.

But there is a difference between a trillion humans dying now and 100 trillion humans dying in 100 years or a quadrillion humans dying in 1000 years.

I will be here for each and every human death. No matter how long it takes.
