It was supposed to be a simple quick attempt at me grabbing supplies to go back to my room.

But, God must have decided that the place my door would open to was an active battle between two armies, all I could hear was screams, and the clashing of steel until I finally was knocked unconscious…

As I began to slowly awake, I had the slight sensation that I was moving in a wooden seat, I felt cold air brushing against my face, and the sound of horses…

My eyes began to flutter open, wincing from the bright sun that seemed to shine directly into them like a middle finger from the Divines…

I couldn’t move my arms no matter how much I tried to pull, looking down to see that no only was I sitting on a carriage, but my hands were also bound.

“Psst, hey.” 

A male’s voice called out to me, making me raise my head and seeing another bound man was sitting across from me in…a blue uniform. 

“Hey, you, you’re finally awake…”

Hearing that phrase seemed to make my mind activate fully like the flip of a switch, the revelation of the situation was becoming quite clear to me now…

Oh no…

This was going to be very annoying, isn’t it…?
