“… Mr. Clean?”

One of the cultists spoke into the silence.

The shining man sighed, and made a brief wave. The offending cultist incinerated in a brief flash, dust settling into a small pile. The mob of cultists parted around the place where a cultist had once stood. 

The shining man minced over to the pile, which he briefly swept into a dustpan which disappeared after use. He turned to the place where the head cultist, resplendent in red robes, lay prostrate and trembling.

“Oh, get up.” His voice rose with impatience. “Mr. Clean was my prophet, sent to help you find the joy of cleanliness. But humanity has continued in its slovenly ways.” 

The shining man’s bleach white eyebrows lowered as his eyes narrowed.

“Mr. Clean is no more. Call me…. Mr. Cleanse.”
