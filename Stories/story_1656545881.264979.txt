"What is the fundamental flaw with Avocados?" I read aloud. "What a weird question."

My wife leaned into the doorframe from the hallway. "Steve, I still don't think you should be reading that. Isn't reading someone else's mail, like, a Federal crime?"

"Idunno" I replied, as I wrote out my answer. 

"Shouldn't we track down the previous owner and send it to them?" She asked. 

"We got this from auction, I think it was an old dude's estate or something." I skimmed down the page to the next question. "No living relatives or whatever. Hey, this is a fun one."

My wife succumbed to her curiosity, and stepped closer to read the questionnaire. "If Adolf Hitler from Nazi Germany and Lieutenant Worf from Star Trek TNG kissed, how much of their facial hair would be in contact?" She glanced back at me. "Ok, this is utter nonsense. Have fun finishing it, I'm going for a jog." 

She kissed me and left, putting in her earbuds and resuming her Harry Potter audiobook as she did. 

I smiled, and resumed the questionnaire. I though of my answer before I wrote it. 

"It depends on the amount of passion" I wrote. 

It didn't seem like these were the kind of questions that could lead to immortality, but I didn't know which ones would. It was still fun. I pressed on. 

"When a Penguin and a Pigeon fall in love, can their children fly?"

I pondered this one as well. Obviously, I wondered how the two would even meet, but thats not what the question asked. 

"If they were adopted from a species that could fly, then yes" I wrote back. It made sense to me, since the two couldn't have biological children. Well, most likely. I don't know if it had ever been tried before. 

I kept my original answer, and moved on to the next question. 

"If a ghost and a zombie came from the same dead person, which would be the original consciousness?"  This one was easy. I wrote "The Ghost. A zombie by definition does not have a functioning brain."

If this was all it took to become immortal, I thought, then everyone would do it. Maybe thats why this was invite only. 

The final question seemed to be the hardest one yet. "If a pot of gold was located at the end of a rainbow, on which end would it reside?" I read. 

This one was a real doozy. I took a guess. 

"on the Right side" I wrote. 

Suddenly, the thick paper began to glow, with a brilliant golden light. The questions and my answers both faded from the page, and a single word emerged in their place. 

"***Correct***"

A heavenly chorus faded into existence, singing a song with no words that moved my very soul. My dog Looked up from his position on the couch, gave a slight 'boof', and flopped back onto the cushions. I took that as a resignation from his guard dog duties.

"***GILROY LIVINGSTON***", a voice boomed from within. "***WITH A FINAL SCORE OF 97%, YOU HAVE PASSED THE TEST, AND EARNED YOUR PLACE AMONG THE IMMORTALS***"

The voice paused breifly. "***YOU ARE NOT GILROY***"

"Uh, no, I'm Steve" I said. "Nice to meet you."

There was a considerably longer pause. 

"***YOU KNOW OPENING SOMEONE ELSE'S MAIL IS, LIKE, A FEDERAL CRIME, RIGHT?***"
