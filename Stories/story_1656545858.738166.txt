INT. BAR

Open in a rundown bar, where a Hitman, Drunk, and a Photographer are sitting around a table having drinks.

The Hitman turns towards the Drunk.

Hitman

Did you ever hear of really doing the perfect shot?

Drunk

What?  I am really going to do it,  the perfect shot here.

The drunk gestures to the shot glass in front of him, and sinks it down.

Photographer

\*I\* really need the perfect shot, or there goes my news job.

Hitman

I may have a tip for you.

INSERT SHOT

Under the table, we see the Hitman turn off a small digital tape recorder.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP

A sniperscope is setup on a rooftop overlooking a governmental plaza.  We see the knocked out Drunk slumped over it.  A clock chimes the hour. Down on the plaza, a man comes out of the building.  The Hitman takes out a cellphone and calls the police.  The Hitman takes out the recorder and plays the Drunks voice on it to the 911 operator.

Recorder

I am really going to do it,  the perfect shot here.

The Hitman pulls the Drunk up on top of the rifle, and covering his hand with his own, shoots the man in the plaza.

CUT TO:

EXT. PLAZA

The Photographer gets a great shot of the Drunk pulling the trigger on the sniper rifle.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP

The Hitman drops everything and walks off, leaving the Drunk passed out over the rifle.
