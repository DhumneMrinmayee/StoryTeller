**AITA for using a youth potion on a date?**

Hello reddit! My name is Miriam, and I am 340F witch.

I have recently downloaded this incredible app called Tinder that lets you go on dates. Feeling ecstatic, I introduced my best friend, Joanna (320F) to the app.

We were both thrilled with how modern, and easy dating was, because... To be honest,  kidnapping is just too much work, and neither of us has the energy nowadays. However, here is where Joana and I came to a disagreement.

See, I uploaded one of my younger pictures onto the app. My friend, Joanna, claims that it is a bit deceitful to use a younger picture of myself. I reassured her it was not, as I would just use a youth potion before the date, and nobody knows the difference. Besides, makeup and filters seem much worse than a youth potion, and people tolerate those, do they not?

However, Joanna's sister (390F) told Joanna that the youth potion might be a bit problematic for other reasons. To all of you who skipped alchemy, the main ingredient of a youth potion is the blood of children. Joanna's sister called it unethical to take the blood of children.

To me, that makes no sense, as:

1. Children have a lot of blood. Why wouldn't they share? It is not like I would purposely drain enough blood to kill them. And I only need about 100-200ml of blood for a potion.
2. I would ask the child first. Hey, do you want to help this nice old lady out? I need to go on a date, and my mate expects me to look younger. I need the blood. If I were a child, I would give that old lady some blood, she clearly needs it.

So, AITA?
