The Genie took the contract scroll and pulled on the end of the page. The document was already unfurled to its maximum extent and yet it grew longer by enough space for a single sentence. 

*Any wish made may not modify the genie in any way without express agreement from the genie.*

"There," they said, "and for making me put a new rule in place, I'll grant you an extra wish."

"What?" Said the paladin blinking in suprise.

"I have a house rule that if you make me come up with another written rule, I not only don't count that wish, I give you mortals another wish as a little compensation." The genie said this with arms crossed and a coy smile on their face.

"But, the contract-"

"I am limited only two things, my own imagination, and the impetus of another being."

"So I could wish for anything, and you could just not grant that wish?"

A snort, and then, "pretty much. I just put the rules down for the kinds of things I don't like to think about."

The paladin gawked for a moment, mouth agape before their words found them again.

"But thats not how genies work." The genie laughed at that.

"Do you know how we work? No, no you do not. You are just a mortal. To think that a fly like *you* could control me..." More laughter sounded as the genie returned to the lamp. 

The paladin stood there shocked and unsure of what to do next.
