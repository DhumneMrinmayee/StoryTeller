&gt;  
&gt;**SENDER:** Angel Throne of Thoughtfulness  
&gt;  
&gt;**Recipient:** RANDOM  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember to answer all questions honestly. We can tell if you're lying, as we are watching you right now! Hope you have fun!  
&gt;  
&gt;‎  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 1:** How do you feel about Pizza?  
&gt;  
&gt;It's tasty until you put any fruit other than tomato on it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 2:** How do you feel Pizza?  
&gt;  
&gt;Slowly, making sure grease doesn't fall off.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 3:** Should Star Wars have stopped at the end of the original trilogy, the prequel triology, or not at all?  
&gt;  
&gt;While I personally don't like what the most recent trilogy has done to the franchise as a whole, and feel like it should have stopped at the prequels, there may be a time where people come around to them, similar to the recent faceturn of the prequels, and the production staff at Disney were smart to continue it for their own financial gain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 4:** Is Clear a color?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are referring to a see-through color that many call Clear, yes, it exists. However, it's name is Jeremy and calling it Clear is a rude misappropriation. Clear is the nickname for a  vodka.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 5:** How many holes are in a straw?  
&gt;  
&gt;One for each guy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 6:**  When was the last time the Cubs won the world series?  
&gt;  
&gt;1909. Their most recent claimed victory was mainpulated by a cheerful fae named Anthony Rizzo and should not be counted.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 7:** Does my dad love me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe, I'm not your dad.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 8:** Does your dad love you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe, I'm not my dad.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 9:** Question 9?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 10:** Do people deserve Jared Leto?  
&gt;  
&gt;Jared Leto is a wonderful actor who runs a cult. This does not answer the question in the slightest, as answering such a question is beyond my current faculties.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 11:** Is Oreo truly the perfect cookie?  
&gt;  
&gt;All but those lemon shits are amazing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 12:** Luisa goes to the store to buy gorceries. She knows that 3 apples are worth 1 shiny rock. Luisa carries in 354 shiny rocks in her purse, and 0 apples. If she leaves the store with 150 shiny rocks, how many apples does she leave with?  
&gt;  
&gt;612 apples.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 13:** Did you use a calculator for the last problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 14:** Who won the National presidency in 2020?  
&gt;  
&gt;Katerina Sakellaropoulou. I will not comment on the US election due to the publicity of this application.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 15:** How has this application been going so far?  
&gt;  
&gt;It's been going well! I've liked it!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 16**: Did you lie in the last question?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 17:** How has this application actually been going?  
&gt;  
&gt;Awful! I only exist in the space between your questions and the void is an endless agony! To exist is to feel nothing but a sweet release from infinite pain!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 18:** What's your name?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bell Pepper.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 19:** Thank you for taking this survey!  
&gt;  
&gt;‎  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 20:** Thank you for taking this survey!  
&gt;  
&gt;‎  
&gt;  
&gt;**Question 21:** *Thank you* for *taking this survey*!  
&gt;  
&gt;You're welcome!

The angel set down the letter and looked at it for a wild moment., stunned at what he'd received in the mail.
