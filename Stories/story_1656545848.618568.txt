It had been a years, the child's entire life, since the world Earth had been discovered. The alien child paid a gold to the human vender, taking the 'hot dog' that was covered with 'mustard' and 'ketchup' with 'relish' on it.

The meal felt warm on the alien's tentacles, steaming and moist. The alien eagerly took a large bite with their break, the colorful juices coating their skin and beak. It tasted so good. Human food was their favorite. Everyone thought so. It may look disgusting sometimes, but it always made up with how it tasted.

The alien child eagerly suctioned towards their parent.

"How was paying for that 'Hot Dog'? Am I saying it right?" they asked.

&amp;#x200B;

"It's delicious," the child said, mouth still full of meat, sauces, and bun.

&amp;#x200B;

"Any other good foods you want to try buying yourself?" they asked playfully, hugging the younger alien.

&amp;#x200B;

"Yeah, I heard 'pretzals' are good," the child beamed.

&amp;#x200B;

"Well, let's try them then," the parent laughed, enjoying that this world was a place where such meaningful memories could be made.
