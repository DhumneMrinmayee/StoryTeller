"You can't use magic?" The officer double-checked my documents, perplexed. "What do you mean by that?"  

"I absorb magic. Negate it."  

"Elaborate."  

"Well... magic spells don't work on me."  

"That's... strange. So, as collateral... you're saying you can't use magic?"  

"That is correct..."  

The officer had this thoughtful look on his face. He would reject me, just like the rest. Although I excelled at magic theory and combat in the academy, I was a singularity, an unusual case, and thus difficult to manage. My ability was situational and often went to hamper my colleagues. Fighting was all I was good for, but why would they hire me? I was a liability, a mistake, and there were plenty of better options-  

"I'm intrigued, boy."  

"Huh?"  

The officer leaned in. "What can you do?"  

"Oh, uh..." I was flustered. I hadn't expected this response - the interviews would usually wrap up from here. But I saw the old officer's excitement - his curiosity as he waited for me to explain, and I couldn't help but respond with similar enthusiasm. "My 'mana' is like a bubble around me, sir. I can concentrate it or even it out. The denser it is, the quicker it extinguishes magic. It's grown over the years, but... well..."  

"Yes?"  

I needed to tell him. He would find out about it, eventually: the deal-breaker. "It's, well, growing. And, sometimes... sometimes, I can't keep it in. Sometimes, it has a mind of its own. Sometimes, it goes out of its way to devour magic."  

"... That's certainly a problem." As expected. There's no way- "Let's have you master it."  

"Pardon?"  

"You're hired."
