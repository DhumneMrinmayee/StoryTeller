The first time doing this criticsm is requested.

The meteorite was undetected and unseen until it was too late and coming straight for earth. It was believed to have been a massive iron meteorite. When news came out of the meteorite coming straight for earth, people had begun to panic. Riots began to occur on a massive scale with most governments completely collapsing due to the massive exodus of public administrations and the occurring chaos around the globe. Soon most places were under complete anarchy or strict martial law due to the ongoing crisis. Soon the situation had only become worse as a message was sent out from the meteorite, “Thank you for saving our species. Your sacrifice will be honored for eternity." Most had lost all hope of survival by this point and had come to accept their fate. Once the day had finally come most stood outside ready to see the meteorite themselves but in a massive twist of fate it turns out it had ended up missing by only a near 10,000 miles. People were stunned wondering how a meteorite heading straight for the earth at the last second changed course.
