It started when I tripped and fell in a bonfire. My family always supported me and tried to hold regular gatherings to help me not feel so alone, even if anyone from the neighborhood didn’t really show up. I tripped on my own two feet and went straight in to the fire. The fire, of course, was magical for the sake of convenience. My parents, of course, freaked. But another not “of course” thing happened. It didn’t burn. My parents were thankful at the miracle that befell them. And to test my theory I immediately leapt back in to the flames. Same result.

This was a game changer. I grabbed a rock and went to Greg’s house. Greg was a dick. He’d always try and scare me with walls of fire when I walked past his house. Not this time, though, oh no no no. Predictably he casts wall of fire, but I traipse right through. Understandably unnerved he casts magic missile. A direct hit and no effect. Visibly panicking he runs inside and up his stairs he trips just before the top step. I raise my rock in anticipation. In a last ditch effort he casts mage hand to snatch my rock. He does and bludgeons me to death with it. Unfortunately, no resistance to non magical damage
