I threw my bag on the bed in a huff. Stomping over to my PS4, I wrenched out my copy of Yakuza 6, tempted to snap the disc in half before settling on forcefully placing it back in it's box. I'd thought I might be able to get some food with a credit card or Google Pay, but I was accosted by ruffians from the outset. I quickly gathered all my Yakuza games and added them to the 'avoid pile', joining the likes of Bloodborne, Catherine, and Devil May Cry 5. I sighed, wishing I enjoyed Animal Crossing for what must've been the 800th time. Unfortunately, my collection was starting to thin. If a game wasn't insanely dangerous for a normie like myself, it likely didn't accept any form of payment that I could offer. Stealing was always an option of course, but it was one I wanted to keep on a back burner in case game logic might still apply. Lord knows I've played enough Link's Awakening to understand how dangerous that can be. 

I was nearing the ene of my rope though. I'd scraped through on a couple of lucky finds in Breath of the Wild, but I was desperate for food that wasn't wild mushrooms or berrys (and preferably didn't come with the risk of Octorocks sniping me from 80 yards away, the bruise is still tender). If only I hadn't refunded Stardew Valley. 

As I walked defeated back to my collection, a thought began to form. I began searching through my DS games, scanning for the one thing that could possibly save me until I found it. My old copy of Cooking Mama, back from when I was in middle school. How this game survived my collection all this time is a mystery, but FINALLY, I might be able to get some food, if not from Mama then somewhere else at least. The cartridge settled with that all too familiar click and with a press of the power, my DS came to life. I settled my nerves before calmly taking a step out into the world.
