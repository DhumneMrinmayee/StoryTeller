it was a dark and mysterious figure, just lurking in the shadows. she was walking under a bridge. it was cold, in the dead of night. the figure had caught her eye a few times, but it had been a long day and she assumed she was imagining it. she heard the slightest of noises. normally, she would ignore it but in this case it gave her the biggest fright of her life. she stopped dead in her tracks.

she looked around, there was nothing

there was nothing that could have made the noise. she was about to set off before she realized that the figure was gone. her pulse began to rise. her breaths increased rapidly. she turned around, thinking about making a run for it. she felt something come up behind her. it tapped her shoulder. she spun around, almost having a heart attack. she thought this was the moment. she thought this was the end of her life. she knew that her town had a large vampire population, now she knew that she would add one more to that population.

the figure spoke to her, in the calmest and most gentle voice she had heard. she didn't let that distract her though. she was considering every possible way to get out of the situation. every seemingly simple, stupid, or juvenile way to escape. she wanted to live another day. she didnt want this to be her last day as a human

"Hi there, you seem stressed about something," The figure said to her. She suddenly lost any feeling of terror from her body. She could tell from its body language alone that it ment her no harm. 

&amp;#x200B;

"Sorry, i saw you in the shadows and i thought you were going to turn me" She responsed. she was still careful. no amount of genuine concern for her could remove the fact that the figure was a vampire. she had known it for all of about 20 seconds. she learnt not to trust people that quicky. another vampire tried the same tactic on her previously and she made the mistake of trusting it.

&amp;#x200B;

"You know im a vampire. why aren't you more terrified? i could easily kill you. i wont but it would be easy to do" The figure asked her. its voice was the most pleasant and pleasing voice possible. it genuinely calmed her. calmed her to a point where she was in significant danger. if she let her guard slip for even a second, she was vampire food.

&amp;#x200B;

"im not terrified, im petrified. i know vampires. tell me why i shouldnt kill you". she knew she could trust it, but she wanted to make sure that it was not going to hurt her. she wanted to make sure that this was not some sort of scheme, some sort of cunning plan to get her to fall for the tactics.

"i was turned against my will. i died in the middle of the night. i was clueless for days, i just felt a little out of my usual self. the only reason i noticed is that someone told me i had fangs.  ive never had the urge for blood, and i dont burn in the sun. the people that know me love me to death, but the people that dont assume i want to kill them. i wouldnt wish it upon my worst enemy" the figure announced. she could hear the dispair in its voice. she knew that it was likely a mistake, but she decided to trust the figure. she symathised with him, feeling his pain. they decided to go for a drink, as she had nothing else to do. they walked away from the bridge, into the darkness.
