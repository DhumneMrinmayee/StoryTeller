**AITA for trying to eat children?**

Look, I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out. I (59F) have a gorgeous home in the middle of the woods. It’s my pride and joy and I built it myself out of candy. I’m a master confectioner so I truly value my creation and don’t have much visitors over, since I know the candy can be tempting. Anyway, one day I was out in the woods and I came back to my cottage to find it destroyed! The walls had entire sides bitten out, the sugarcane glass was completely licked away, and my licorice fence was torn to pieces. I was so devastated, and when I went inside my home I found two little brats (maybe 6 and 8? A boy and girl) still eating my home! The inside was worse—the kids grubby hands melted all of my chocolate brickwork, my lollipop chandelier was shattered, and my gumdrop backsplash was completely ruined. It’s been two months since and I’m STILL repairing what they ate/broke. I was so upset that I threw the kids into my oven, but they  escaped and ran back to their village. Anyway I sort of think I’m the asshole since I threw them in my oven, but technically I didn’t get to eat them so I’m not sure. The oven wasn’t even on. AITA?

Edit to add my comment from down below for more context:  the children returned a few days later and destroyed my house a second time and tried to throw ME in MY OWN OVEN. I’m lucky I didn’t die.

Update: okay I get it, I’m the asshole, I’m not responding to comments anymore. If your house was being eaten by snot-nosed kiddies, you’d probably feel the same.
