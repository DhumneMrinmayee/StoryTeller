People always fear that which they do not understand, and I suppose at this point that is wise. I’ve been ostracized since the beginning. After all, when everything is magical, that which isn’t is at least an aberration.

It wasn’t until I was grown that I truly understood what it meant. Magic is not merely some power or energy to be harnessed. It suffuses the very soul of every living thing. Well, every living thing except for me.

Just touching another robs them of their vitality. It’s not an instant death sentence, but it’s pain, nonetheless. Weapons and armor are meaningless to me, but I wear them all the same. Not to protect myself, but to protect others. Should I walk this world unprotected, all may die.

I’ve overthrown tyrants, overtaken a thieves guild, slain a dragon, but it all means nothing. I will never know happiness. I will never feel the touch of another. But I will continue to persevere. It is what my parents asked of me.

So I remain here in this empty castle. I overthrew the king who killed my parents for birthing me. But I may well become like him. Killing me would have been a mercy. I wish I was old enough to know that then. 

To any who come across this memoir, I leave this warning. When the next child is born with an immunity to magic, do not allow them to live. Ending their existence is a mercy, not only to them, but to this world.
