He was supposed to be the greatest warrior the world has ever seen, capable of massacring whole armies by himself. At full strength, his power rivaled that of gods in legends. So when my war party and I came across him meditating in a swamp and he agreed to join our side, we felt justified in our celebrations, happy that we had acquired a true trump card. That he was a large frog made no difference to us. Sure, in a world of walking felines, elves, turtles, and more, he certainly stood out being the only one of his kind. But after ten thousand years, someone entered the Frey that was capable of permanently turning the tide of this war.

Or so we thought.

We knew when we brought him on that his power came with a caveat. It wasn't something he could activate at will. We guessed that meant he would turn into an unstoppable killing machine in the heat of battle, or would acquire powers beyond comprehension when his life was in danger, or would snap when he was angry.

When we were ambushed by the Army of the South, we weren't worried. Yes, we were greatly outnumbered, them possessing 10 men for every 1 soldier we had. We were outmatched, them using new technology capable of slicing our armor straight through. But we weren't worried. We had a trump card, the legendary warrior himself on our side ready to bring the southern army to its knees for daring to attack us.

Yet here I stand, illuminated by moonlight, surrounded by carnage and the bodies of my fallen comrades. The enemy relentlessly and ruthlessly advancing, not giving us any time to regroup, plan, or retreat. The warrior was one of the first to fall and everyone saw it. With his life went our morale, our hope, and in return we felt nothing but sorrow and helplessness. We were fighting a losing battle.

Legends may just be legends after all.

My war party was on the retreat behind me. Their army was still advancing towards us. I had to buy time for my comrades to escape.

Bloodied, left arm limp, armor in tatters but sword in hand, I stood and walked towards the advancing army. Step by step, over my fallen comrades, over trampled grass and blood stained cloth. Over weapons and shields and bows left behind by those who no longer had to power to use them.

I stopped near his body and looked down. Even without power, he died swinging a sword. I looked ahead of me at the army, advancing in line, some 70 yards in front of me. I, too, would die swinging my sword, buying precious seconds so the rest could retreat.

*March, march, march*

I lifted my sword by my side, took a battle stance, and readied myself. I looked up to the sky one last time, the moon was seconds from taking its place in the center of the cosmos. Midnight. I couldn't ask for a better time to die.

I looked ahead, the army was right in front of me. They made no effort to charge me, to shoot me. They likely saw me for what I was: a non-threat. They did not want to grant me a true warriors death and instead treated me like an obstacle in their path. But I would show them.

10 yards.

I lifted my blade, screamed, and swung at the lead soldier, ready for him to parry my weak strike and strike me down.

My blade met his shield. But his blade did not meet me.

I expected death. I expected to feel the piercing cold steel of death in my chest. I looked down. Instead, his blade was stopped just short of my heart, as if suspended in time. Then I looked up and there was a blade in his neck and a blue aura surrounding it, as if he was killed by a powerful magic.

The rest of the army stopped in their tracks, shocked at this development. Then, suddenly, they were all pushed backwards, as if a strong gust of wind just blew against their entire front line.

I didn't understand what was happening until I looked at who was holding the blade still lodged in the lead soldiers neck.

It was him. Risen from the dead, his eyes filled with blue fire and his body completely free of damage. There was wind flying around the hand he waved at the army. He looked at me and nodded. "I will take it from here." he croaked.

"Your powers..." I spoke weakly, "they've activated?"

He pointed up in response. I tilted my head. In the sky, the moon had taken its proper place in the center of the cosmos, shining brighter than I've ever seen it before. I looked back at him, expecting an answer.

He said five words, five croaks, before he blasted forward and began tearing their army to pieces in a show of speed, elegance, and power that I may never see again. Within minutes, their front line was decimated and he was working his way through the entire army. Truly a sight to behold.

But I'll never forget what he said before he saved my life, before he embarked on a battle that would be known as the beginning of the end of the thousand year war...

"It is Wednesday, my dude."
