"Well- hm, I could kill you far faster and more painful than a human! Plus you could always buy a gun or a Kevlar vest to defend yourself from a mere man!"


"Yeah, I could also just buy garlic or poppy seeds which are way cheaper"


"Oh come on! You know the counting thing is a myth!"


"Don't lie to me. I remember that time I spilt a container of airsoft pellets! You counted every single one!


"*Grr* fine, but I could curse you with immortality! Isn't the thought of everyone around you withering away terrifying?"


"Sure but it's hard to call it immortality when I can just walk into the sun or buy a silver bullet when I'm ready to go. Doesn't sound that bad"


"*huff* but you would be bound to the night for the rest of your life, imagine the limitations!"


"I can always wear a cloak. It'll look a bit odd but otherwise isn't that hendering"


The vampire sat down with a look of confusion, as if re-thinking his entire existence. 

"Maybe this whole vampirism thing isn't that bad... maybe humans are the biggest threat..."


"Cheer up bud, At least you can turn into a bat! That's pretty cool!"


"Yeah... it is... *sniffle* you know, maybe you're onto something... maybe I should use a gun in batform! Death from above... it's genius!"


"Maybe calm down a bit, I don't think that's a good-"


"ALL WILL FEAR THE FLYING COUNT GUNMAN!" He follows with an evil laugh.


"*sigh* there he goes"

If you have any advice or criticism I'd love to hear it. Also, I'm currently writing on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues.
