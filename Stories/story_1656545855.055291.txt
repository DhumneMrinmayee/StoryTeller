"You ok?" The stranger asked as I sat on the sidewalk. "Not really, but It's something out of my control." I resonded while sipping from my little carton of chocolate milk. "Alright dude." They said before walking on. I finished it off them started on the next one. Of all the stupid things that could happen.    

 First, I move into town for work. Get a girlfriend, get dumped. Find another one, get dumped again because it turns out they were friends. That was fine, wasn't like the relationships had time to get that deep. I'd move on with my life and that was that. 

Then I had a hard day at work and decided to have a beer or two. Thats where I fucked up. Next thing I know I run into both of them, we get to talking and drinking. Then I wake up the next day with 2 girls and a matching set of bite marks. Turns out the first romantic relationships i managed to have in a few years were both monsters. I can't even call them that because now I'm one too. A Werewolf/Vampire/Human being. 
How the absolute fuck does that happen? Hell If I know. Actually I shouldn't say that. With my luck a demon would come by. "Well thats rude." I looked up and saw the man who walked by earlier standing over me with a case of Yoohoos'. "Before you ask, yes I am a demon. And I heard what happened to you. Want to talk about it?"
