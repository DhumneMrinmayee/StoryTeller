(If you have criticism, feel free to say it.)

"You know why you'll never be #1?" the pale, sickly woman said, grinning. Her breath was shallow from *Whiskey's* painful hold. "Why you'll never have my title? Why you'll never become *Vodka*?"

"Quit your... your mind-games! To think you'd have the audacity to say that even at death's door!" *Whiskey* whispered. He pressed his knife closer to *Vodka's* throat. They were in a discrete Barnhouse at midnight - the perfect time and place to kill her. "You're asking to die."

"You need to listen, for your sake.  I once overheard the boss say that-"

"Don't fuck with me, *Vodka*! I'm not falling for your tricks! You're my target, for god's sake."

"*Whiskey*, I'm telling you - you're in their web. You're *The Distillery's* puppet, and they're making you dance. It's a pathetic sight, so I've elected to help you out of good faith. And because I'm no longer a part of *The Distillery*, I can do that."

"Do you want me to kill you, you traitorous bitch?!" the man cried, now throwing caution to the wind. "Because I can!"

*Vodka* chucked. "It's been a good while since you disarmed me, so... why haven't you killed me? Isn't that what you came here to do? You idiot? I see through you, so don't fuck with *me*, *Whiskey*. You are stalling this assassination either because you want my information or because you truly give a damn about me. Either way, you're a lousy assassin for it. And it means I'm valuable to you. Now, let me go, and I'll tell you what I know."

*Whiskey* reluctantly weakened his grip, and *Vodka* snaked her way onto her feet. "Go on, then, *Vodka*," he said quietly. "You better be telling the truth."

*Vodka* inhaled deeply. "Okay. Think about this: you're an excellent assassin, *Whiskey*. Better than me, in some cases. And you take extra effort and precautions to get the job right. That's your value. Now, what would happen if the boss gave you the title of *Vodka*? You wouldn't try as hard as you do now, would you? Because you would have achieved a long-sought ambition. That's why he's not giving you it." Whiskey opened his mouth in objection, but *Vodka* objected to his objection. "- Ah! If you're worried about proof, you'll have to take my word for it. I heard the boss talk to Wine about this exact matter a few months ago.

"Now, what are you going to do about it?"
