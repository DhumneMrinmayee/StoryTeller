Jane  
I remember our first birthday together. Awkward laughs, two empty bottles of wine, a half eaten king-sized order of McDonalds and a promise to come together again next year. Moving to a new city had been difficult, I was sure it was going to be my first birthday alone. In a moment of weakness, I waved at my next-door neighbour and made some dumb comment about the weather. Little did I know I would end up here, with Mitch, my saving grace, my way out of this fucking hillbilly city. I swear I didn’t plan to let things get this far, I didn’t plan on using him for all of this, he just dropped into my hands I swear to you. All it took was a comment about how goddamn humid it was…

I’ve always loved my birthday. I know it’s a weird thing for a 43-year-old man to say, but gosh darn do I love it. August 8th is and always will be my favourite day of the year. Cards, cake, presents, even people singing me happy birthday, I love it all. The first day of my 40th year I was lucky enough to meet her, Jane, we had a lovely discussion about the weather which lead into an even lovelier evening of intellectual discussions over some excellent wine I imported from Chile. Finally, someone who enjoys their birthday as much as I do! And we’ve been able to create our own little collection of Aug8-ers as we call ourselves along the way. From Louise joining us for an impromptu camping trip up in Algonquin Park to our sky diving trip last year with both Louise and Matty, Jane and I know how to celebrate this holy day!

I can’t believe I let him convince me to go to Algonquin Park of all places. No A/C, mosquitoes galore and a complete lack of running water? Sign me up! Even worse was the sky diving, you mean I have to pay you $200 bucks to jump out of a plane? Are you kidding me? At least I was able to add Matty and Louise to the plan. After learning that Mitch was a billionaire, you read that right not a millionaire a Billionaire, capital B, I knew I had to do everything I could to stay in his inner circle, no matter how disgusting I found him. Matty focuses on the “guy talk” learning about Mitch’s real views, you know the “locker room talk” and pretty little Louise is busy working what God gave her, those natural assets. If I can’t get on the will as his “adopted daughter” then she’s hopefully getting on there as his wife. The only problem so far is Frank, the newcomer that Mitch found, I have no idea who this asshole is but he isn’t one of us. He’s dangerous, a buff guy who seems to already have a relationship with Mitch. All three of us know that its time to make a move soon, there’s only so long I can put up with being an “Aug8-er”, it’s time to end this long con, 3 years is long enough, we’re ending it tonight on August 7th.    
  
Mitch  
I told Jane last year that she was like a daughter to me. I’ve never married- complicates things too much, and never had any kids- they don’t interest me much. I’m a man of simple tastes, a good wine and a hard day’s work are all I really need, that plus a good birthday celebration each year and I’m all set. The Aug8-ers are good for me, gets me some social connections outside of work and provides me with some perspective, my “adopted family” as I call them. I really thought it was all luck at first, how lucky of me to find these great people, how fun that we all share a birthday! I , of course, immediately had my team run a background check on all of them. Ex-cons, or perhaps not so ex, with birthdays in September and April, news stories plastered across the Internet about all of them. Tax fraud for Louise and a joint robbery by Matty and Jane, I can’t believe they gave me their real names. I don’t feel unsafe as they may be the dumbest criminals in history. I can’t believe she didn’t question the addition of Frank, my security guard who frankly is doing a shit job at pretending to be a Aug8-er. Originally, I was planning on doing a big reveal, that I have known their master plan to take my money all along. But honestly the company has been nice, it’s lonely at the top. I’ve already changed my will, if we last 4 years as Aug8-ers not only will I pay off all their debts and clear their criminal records (money is power my friends), I’ll leave them with 15 million each. We’re having the big reveal tomorrow night- I can’t wait!
