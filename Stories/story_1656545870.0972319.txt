“Well, the newest members are Honeypuff and you, Killmurder”, started Bonesplosion. “I think you two are the most likely suspects.” The others agreed. “Fair enough”, Killmurder started, “but I have my suspicions about you, Creamy. 

“You joined last Tuesday, right Creamy?” 

“Yup!” 

“You were never in our files, right?” 

“Yup!” 

“And your name is Creamy Honeypuff, right?” 

“Yup!” 

“That doesn’t match our names at all! I think it is clear that-” Killmurder began before he got interrupted. 

“Wait just a minute!”, Creamy started. 

“Alright, shoot.” 

“You just joined a week before I did, right?”

“Yes”, Killmurder groaned. “However, I already had documents.” Was Creamy really trying to defend himself? 

“What documents?”, questioned Creamy. “You correctly called them files earlier, but you should know that our files are not physical documents.” 

“Wait, that was just an honest mistake!” 

“As for me, my ‘documents’ have not been assigned since I just defected from the Sugarsweet Clan.” 

“You did?!” 

“Yes; you should know these things, considering that you joined earlier than I did.” 

“Why wasn’t I told this?!”, yelled Killmurder. 

“You would know if you had an official Blood Death Squad email, which you should have,” retorted Creamy. “Besides, how are you even a Commander? That rank isn’t available to people who have been here for less than half a year, including us.” 

“I don’t know”, Killmurder squeaked. 

“Also, your name doesn’t match”, Honeypuff continued.”

“WHAT?! MINE?!” 

“I’ll admit, my name is goofy, but really, Killmurder? That has nothing to do with a human body! That’s just an action. Is that the best the Sugarsweet Clan could come up with? You might have tricked the others, but you can’t trick a Sugarsweet defector like myself.” 

“Wait, I can explain!”, started Killmurder, but the others had already called for security.
