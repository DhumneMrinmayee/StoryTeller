I watched the small human female for a while before the pain in my paw was to much, wincing, best I could padded over and up to her. If it wasn't for her scent telling me her age and health I would have thought her a small cub. Taking care not to show any signs of pain I spoke clear in their language. 

"Human, I need you to do your duty and release me."

 She turned, and watched me for a moment, a 'smile' pulling at her flat features before slow blinking me. I felt taken a back, she is relaxed with a mighty lion as I. My mother's tales of humans ruling the world and what they will 'adopt' hold true. I let out a low few chuffs of a laugh and moved closer to show her my injury. She let out a small gasp before leading me into their 'clinics'. More humans, all showing they are relaxed in my presence calmed my nerves, knowing full well how dangerous humans can be. The bear trap was something only they can creat and destroy. I will say this, they know how make a lion feel welcomed. 

The same human female slow blinked at me and sat in a low chair. 

"How did we do Mr..." 

"Sim-ba, mother has an eye for human classic, makes you humans calmer around us if we keep to what you know and understand" I gave her my best human smile. 

" I will rate your clinic 10/10, Lion approved!"
