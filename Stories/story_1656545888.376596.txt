Slylock Fox and Max Mouse have been tied up and brought before a "jury" composed of Shady Shrew, Slick Smitty, Cassandra Cat, Reeky Rat, Harry Ape, Buford Bull, and Big Brad Wolf. The dastardly villains have started arguing with themselves over what to do with the loot they brought with them when they took Slylock and Max, and some of them have started threatening to let the two go. Who should Slylock convince to switch sides?

(Answer: As a human, Slick Smitty is the only member of the group with the opposable thumbs necessary to untie the ropes holding Slylock and Max. He's the one Slylock should appeal to.)
