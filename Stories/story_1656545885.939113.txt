I turned 10 today. 

I was invited to the professors lab to pick my starter today! Best. Gift. EVER!

It was a really difficult decision but I went with the small cyndaquil that poked it's head from behind the prof. leg. 

He reminds me of myself so I had to. I really hope we'll be best friends 

Camping out, building a fire was easy thanks to cyndaquil. I definitely understand the fanclub president now, fire types are perfect to hug on cold nights.

We ate some oran berries we found on the way and now it's time for bed.

___

Lots of dew on the tent this morning, cyndaquil yawns quite a lot, dont think he can use it in battle sadly.

We eat, pack up and start towards the next city


A wild pidgey keeps eyeing us as we walk. I can't tell if it wants the berry cyndaquil is snacking on or if it's itching for a battle 

I left a berry for the pidgey and now she's following us closely and talking up a storm with cyndaquil

Finally got to the next town, pidgey looked really sad we were gonna part ways so I invited her along, she gladly stayed in the ball so I caught my first wild pokemon!

____

My first gym battle was intense, but my best bud cyndaquil pulled through. Every one of my new friends did really well that battle I'm excited for the next challenge.

___

Really rough day today. Quilava got poisoned by a weird purple spinarak. I'll come back to check it out after healing up my bud.

Grabbed my Geodude from the professors and went out looking for that spinarak.

It took all night but I finally tracked him down, Geodude is raring to go, but I tell him we're not here for revenge, plus he doesn't even know that move so we're just gonna make a new friend!

He was a tough cookie but I caught a spinarak! I showed him and my dex progress to the professor, he was astonished by the new color and asked me to keep it around to see if anything else was different and report back. 

So far my dex is coming along nicely, I've got at least 1 of every pokemon on each route I've been through, and I always try to play with them for a bit before sending them off to the professors. It's definitely been a great day, time to hit the hay!
__

I think I'm going crazy. The prof. Is so demanding that I fill more of the dex out. I know he gave me quilava, and I appreciate that fact more than anything but..this is too much for an 11yr old. I'm gonna keep doing what I have been and spend time with all the new friends we've made 
__

There's still a bit of rivalry between tyohlosion and Ariados, ever since their first encounter all that time ago they try to one up each other. So far my findings are just the color is different, nothings really changed from the data the prof has on him.

__

I've been around the entire region twice over, not too much I havent seen but I feel like something is watching me lately. 
__

I made a mistake. I shouldn't have followed this Pokemon. I..I'm not sure what I can do.

__

That damn celebi. It's been 3 weeks since it spirited me away to this weird jungle. If it wasn't for typhlosion and all my other Pokemon I'd be in some deep trouble.
__

It took me a while but I finally understand. I'm in the past. I just watched Kabuto walk out from the sea to the beach. About 20 of them followed by a kabutops. I think it saw me. Its stare was chilling, but curious. Guess it's never seen a human before. I have a few pokeballs and I'm confident in my team so if push comes to shove, I'll snag em.
__

There's so many extinct Pokemon, well, they're alive now but anyway. I've caught a few of them, and have them stored in my pack, for some reason I can't swap any of them into my party. But they registered in my dex properly so I got that going for me.

__

It's been a year, I've looked for celebi, had a few scuffles with that kabutops and finally caught it. The Kabuto fell in line after their chaos, guess they're in a pack mentality, works for me cus I was able to get a Kabuto as well.  So far that's all but the aerodactyl. omanyte and omastar were fairly easy to catch. Their group looked like a weird ritual, they would weave in a dance like formation that made a helix shape. I dubbed them the helix cult, so praise helix I guess.

___

I have thet feeling of being watched again. I'm on the top of the mountain facing off against aerodactyl and I see celebi hovering overhead watching us. 

I used my last ball but finally got this damn aerodactyl. A sense of accomplishment washes over me and then it happens, celebi. Right in front of my face, there it is. Looking like its had its patience wore thin, staring me in the eyes. It flutters around me and next thing I know I'm back at my campsite. It looks a little rundown and ravaged by the teddyursa that should roam these parts but everything is still here. 

I bet nobody will believe what's happened to me.

___

Mom had so many emotions, words, everything really. She was so worried but I understand it, I told her what happened and she went wide eyed and confused at first but gradually accepted my experience as truth. Now she teases me saying praise helix randomly when she sees me. 

___

I spent a few months home and feel it's time to get back out there. The prof has chilled out a lot, especially after getting his hands on the extinct Pokemon I brought back with me. As soon as I realized I was home they had already transferred to the professor.

___

I finished top 4 in the league. They said my battle style was too wild, but after a year where it was no holds bar, I guess I couldn't get back into the swing of things being regulated. Still pretty happy with how strong everyone got.

___

I got invited by a few friends to explore a cave that was uncovered recently, funnily enough it was the day I came back. So far nothing exciting s happened but I have a weird feeling things are gonna go astray.

__

Crap crap crap crap crap crap. Why did I have to go with those 3, why are all these weird pokemon seemingly after me! I have no clue how or why but uxie mesprit and azelf, lured me to this cave disguised as people, as friends. And now I'm facing a shadowy portal, to Arceus knows where, and hitting the last page in my journal. So if you're reading this, that means I haven't come back yet. I hope you're not being forced through the portal too, but if you are let's meet each other and hopefully get the hell out of this mess.

- D.
The corner where their name is torn or chewd away, it's a really old journal, about 10 years since the last entry. 

"Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf. Open the portal."  I say nervously, and walk through to the unknown.
