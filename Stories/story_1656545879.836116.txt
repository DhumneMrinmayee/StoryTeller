I finally did it. I finally decided that, just to know if it was truly real or not, I would take a knife from my kitchen and cut it; not to kill it, simply to see if it would bleed.  
It did not. Despite cutting it with a knife I knew could tear through even the toughest meats, I could not even get a single drop of blood out of it, or even make it wince in pain.   
“My god!” I said to myself when I realized for a fact that the pet sitting right in front of my lap was no ordinary dog.  
And then, I heard it; it was ever so faint, and if not for my enhanced hearing due to being blind, I’d probably have missed out on it entirely. But I heard someone say “He’s figured it out.”  
At this point, I was scared for my life. I went to my front door, but it wouldn’t open. I tried my window, and despite not even having a lock, I could not get it to open either.  
My “dog” tried to comfort me, as it always did, but a dog I couldn’t even trust to exist anymore didn’t help. So, finally, I realized there was only one way of getting out of this, dead or alive. So I grabbed my chair, and was ready to break through my house by force.  
“STOP!” someone shouted. Someone from my living room, no less.  
“I’m sorry about the fake dog, but we had to make it convincing.” The stranger said. “Come, we have much to discuss.”
