Nothing. 

It wasn't exactly dark or maybe it was and my eyes just couldn't perceive it, my brain being unable to focus. I didn't do anything, didn't react, did nothing at all. It didn't feel like a possibility at all. Heck, *I* didn't feel. Just drifting in and out of conciousness with a horrible feeling, almost like a headache but more bearable. 

My eyes slowly opened, taking in the wooden wall to my left and odd textile covering parts of it. My mouth hung open and one of its corners was sticky. My cheek was somewhat stuck to the odd wall, no, my entire body was leaning against it while curled up in a half-formed fetal position. Carefully, I tried to stretch out my legs, trying to feel how far away a hypothetical floor may be. 

Nothing. 

Then it dawned on me and with a bit of effort I sat up feeling silly but stilly drowsy. "Gah, damn it..." After rubbing the sand out of my eyes I looked towards the alarm clock on my nightstand. "4 PM? Huh, wow." I checked my body not clothed in pyjamas, but in casual clothing, some jogging pants, a comfortably oversized t-shirt that has already started to take on its own smell and needs to be changed and most importantly *gamer* socks. My jacket lay crumplet near the spot I had fallen asleep for some reason, right in front of my room's door. I tried to remember what would lead to me sleeping on the floor, possible reasons. 

Nothing. 

Head empty, I cleaned up my floor (by which I mean picking up the singular jacket and maybe some of the junk that fell out of a tipped over paper bin) and wiped the dried saliva from my face with some tissue paper. "4 PM and it's already that dark." I chuckled to myself. This stuff was always weird to me and changing your clocks by an hour between summer and winter time, while probably not the sole reason for the phenomenon of some evening being rather bright and others being really dang dark, was kinda funny to me and something to ridicule always. It's extra hilarious this time, because it seems to be so dark outside that it looks like someone taped his windows shut with black construction paper. It was low-key interesting, so much so that I challenged my eyes to make something out. 

Nothing. 

Oh, well, time to slurp some tap water or eat something. I began walking to wards the door of my room, but before that I got a little more distracted. My phone wasn't in my pockets, had to look for it, it was under my head pillow for some reason, haha, you know how that is. I took another step towards the door and accidentally kicked my paper bin over; really gotta find a different place for that one. Middle of the room is kinda in the way, but that's just where it's most convient for quick access. Ah, let's stop this charade, why am I procrastinating with leaving my room, exactly? 

I pressed down the door handle and pulled. 

*Nothing.* 

Ah, fuck. "Ah, fuck." Ah fuck. "Ah. Fuck." Ah, fuck. I knew it. "Ah, fuck." I felt myself stumbling. "Ah, *fuck*." My hands tensed up. "*Ah, fuck.*" Yeah, been there, done that. "*Ah, fuck!*" Still doesn't feel great, this revelation. "*Fuck, fuck,* **fuck!**" I slammed my fist against a wall, which hurts. "**FUCK!**" I remember now, guess I didn't want to remember or whatever, but I remember now. Tried to make fun of this already or treat it like a dream, nope, just still stuck here, 3rd day in a row. "I would really like to wake up now." I said in a tone that was supposed to be mocking and lightheartedly jokey, addressed at whatever higher power put me here, but I couldn't hide the shaking in my voice and some of the unintentionally forceful intonation of some syllables. My cheeks were wet. "Please?" 

Nothing. 

Ah, fuck. I shouldn't joke about this and it's not too funny, but the nonchalant 'Ah, fuck.' is all that I have right now to, well, not really cheer me up, but to keep me from spiralling even further, maybe. Actually, I don't know, is it mentally healthy? Is it bad? It's been three days, THREE DAYS. My phone's and laptop's batteries are dead and there is no signal in this place, so I cannot look up something about the mental implications of holding onto things like phrases and I do not trust myself enough to psychoanalyse myself. I guess most therapists wouldn't do that either. Am I sure? No, but I can't look it up, because- 

Ah, fuck. I'm spiralling again. Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck. After taking a deep breath and crouched down besides my mini fridge, opening it for no reason, because I already know what's in it. 

Nothing.
