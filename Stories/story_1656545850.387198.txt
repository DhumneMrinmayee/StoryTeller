‘You see, Sarah has a crush on James, the new accountant, and he kinda likes her too, but Elizabeth also likes him!’ the young Dragon clamoured excitedly.

‘So?’ her mother asked with a shrug.

‘So, when Sarah was preparing her business proposal with James, Elizabeth changed some numbers when she was acting as an intermediary between them, so under scrutiny of the committee it would embarrass Sarah and screw over her promotion, and make her angry at James.’

‘Wow, Elizabeth sounds like a bitch.’

‘She is!’ the young dragon agrees happily, ‘However, Sarah ends up double checking her numbers after she has written her proposal, and calls James after hours to ask about some numbers that don’t seem quite right, and James realises something is off, so they end up working together throughout the night, deepening their relationship even further in the process.’

‘Haha, serves Elizabeth right!’ her mother chuckles, but then she pauses.

‘Wait, you are roleplaying right? Which one of you is roleplaying as that bitch Elizabeth?’

‘Me.’ The young dragon replies proudly.

There was a short pause, followed by a sigh.

‘Go to bed.’

‘Yes Mum.’
