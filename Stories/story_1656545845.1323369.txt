At dinner, I served the king wine flush with poison. The whole bottle was  deadly poison with a splash of wine. Fingertip-test-like-we-test-Sir-Roland's-Nostril-Pop-Powder deadly. As soon as I set the glass down, he thoughtlessly drank from it. I was in heaven. This couldn't have worked out any better. 

Or so I thought. With wide eyes, I watched him devour his meal with greasy fingers and suck down the entire bottle of blood-red Bordeaux.

At the end of the meal, he walked up to me and got real close. As his breath bouqueted me in an acrid  sour-grape cloud, he drunkenly whispered in my ear, "Next time you make poison, make sure it really works. It was pathetic."

And that is how I met the Dread Pirate Roberts.
