At Midnight, the Hunter was annoyed by the sound of knocking at the door to his room, shifting around on his mattress for a moment before realizing that the source wasn’t going to be leaving any time soon, would stand up and tiredly stumble his way to the door.

“What is it…?”

On the other side of the door was his roommate, one of his most hated enemies, a vampire was sheepishly holding a bottle of empty milk that seemed to have the Hunter’s name on it.

“Do you have twenty bucks?”

This gained a confused expression as the Hunter opened the door before looking upon his milk with his face turning into exasperated annoyance…

“Three hundred fucking years alive, but you still can’t read basic english?”

He considered force feeding his roommate the wooden cross that hung over his door after a rather awkward day when they discovered each other’s nature.

“Please continue your whinging after I buy you some more milk, or, I could just drink you?”

The Hunter saw a chance for an obvious joke that he would never miss, growing the ghost of a smile.

“Oh, and confirm our neighbors suspicions? It would certainly be more believable than the actual truth.”

That left the Vampire with a twitching eyebrow, letting a low hiss and a show of his fangs as the Hunter gave him the required money before closing the door in his face.

“One of these days, you’re gonna wake up with my fangs in your neck!”

The Hunter laughed proudly and mockingly as he made his way to his bed, feeding off the frustration of his roommate.

“And you’ll find my boot broken off in your ass if you try it, get some garlic too, it’ll help you shut up!”

Loud, offended, and shocked sputtering could be heard from the other side of the door.

“Fuck you!”

“Not today, bloodsucker.”

This was an almost daily routine for the two of them at this point, but they made it work.
