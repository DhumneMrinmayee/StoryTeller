Roughly a hundred years ago, back when the films of grand star wars came out, and you asked someone what they thought aliens would be like if they found earth, they'd probably say something along the lines of; bloodthirsty, savage, or smart. But everything we thought about them was wrong, well, not the last one, but you get what i mean. When i was tasked with treating the alien diplomates to dinner, me being Asian and all, left them speechless when i had brought them to a Korean barbeque with a side of Swedish chocolates for afterward, but i had overestimated how much they'd be able to consume before becoming full. Of course we'd tested their biology with all of the food they had eaten, apparently, soy sauce works the same to them as weed does to a human. So that went over well. When the night was done and the sun started rising these aliens were all but tuckered out, i believe one of them asked for the largest size of soy sauce before devouring it all in only two gulps. Now, they were fine to do so of course, it wasn't bad for them, more like how you can get full and then passing out from a food coma, it's just something you remember doing but there's no damage to anything.   
So to summarize my yelp review, 5stars, would come again. Great service!
