"You are all so mind-numbingly STUPID and shallow that living here put me into a deep depression.  Life had no meaning, no vibrance, no purpose.  The bank heists, the kidappings - f*k it was easy.  And dull.

This woman here changed everything.   She is the reason I still have a will to live.  She is BRILLIANT.  I've improved in every way since she started to challenge me - and she hasn't lost once!  And she has to work WITH you dumb f*cks to do it!  If I win once against her, and rid the world even a little of your filth, it will be my opus.

She is a true and rare talent - and yes, the world is worse off for her efforts, but you get to witness true masters battle right in front of your eyes!  And your side wins, solely because of her! Are you all really so miserable that you can't take the win?!  Are you REALLY THIS STUPID!"
