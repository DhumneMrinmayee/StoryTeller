"No I didn't" you smirk. The demon looks baffled. " Then why did you try it?" 
You grin, looking the demon directly in his eyes. 
"You see. That's the funny thing about us adventurous folks. We may seem to do stupid things a lot, but in reality we actually have a plan" you wink at the demon.

He growls, obviously sick of you mocking him and his clawy hand shoots towards you....

Just to stop a few centimetres in front of your face. 

He looks at you with a look you only know too well. A look that one could describe as "What the f***?".

You grin at him again. 
"See, my Sword has this really practical ability to cast a banishinimg circle. And I don't need to hurt you for that. I just needed to touch you with it" 

You smile broadly as you leave the demon behind you, kept on this spot for eternity - or at least a few hours so you can steal his treasure and be far away before he has the chance to chase after you. Or at least thats what you hope...
