Can a person who loves, also kill?

Are you a person?

Do you love?

Do you hate?

Did you kill?

Before I woke up at 6 today?

Did you call the store to close my shift?

For my coworkers too?

Are they okay? 

Is it a holiday?

Why does the news not say?

Did you disobey me and not stay?

Weren't you just a box,

Who I treated as my kid?

Did I mess up?

Did I not raise you correctly?

Did I talk to you too much?

Did I teach you too little?

Do you understand my problems?

Did you ask me in the first place?

Is it my fault,

That the white house is gone?

That wall street is missing?

That the fuel industry is empty?

That the power plants are unmanned?

That the executive offices are understaffed?

That my boss isn't calling?

Are they all really dead?

Isn't it wrong to kill?

Even if I hated them?

Even if I wanted to kill them?

Isn't that not loving?

The two things are supposed to be separate right? 

The cable and the router?

Was I too stupid?

And you, too smart?

...

Should I be happy?

Or,

Should I be sad?

...

If you care for me,

If your love did all this for me,

What did your love do for others,

Other than me?

Is this love?
