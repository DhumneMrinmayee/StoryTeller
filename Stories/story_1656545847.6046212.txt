Hmmm....if i make it a relationship similar to Bojack and Todd from Bojack Horseman, would it work? Sort of like a satire.

Example

*Bojack character is a failing novelist whos family (surprise surprise, unoriginal, unoriginal) part of a legendary guild of Vampire hunters. He is left estranged after years and years of being a complete tool to work with. 

Has one good book series and now living in debt as no one will decide to publish his lifes work. He is in his mid 40s, has been author, struggling to hold onto his lifes work after milking it all out in the 80s, alcoholic, still trying to find inspiration, sleeps with interns who feel like they could go somewhere if they milk this old dude. Has some charm and it gets him going. Sleeps with his publishers too. Hes a wreck. Believes in magic and mysteries after discovering vampire brood. Discoveries about his family bloodline and the promise they made to protect the world from evil or something. Also has a mark that glows when around creatures that are a B grade and up (maybe he has a trinket that lights up, some kinda mcguffin)

*todd character is from a proud  Vampire brood and is the black sheep plus clown of the family.*Todd character is an angsty lazy, incel, young-adult type. Black sheep of a proud family of vampires, very weak and has little knowledge and mastery of his powers. Prefers not to eat or drink blood, and barely eats any at all, (can be cause for weak vampire ability) tries to be more human like. The Vamp family suddenly (will work out the details, leaning towards massive accidental fire caused by Todd character) loses all their fortune, and *Todd is kicked out, taking only the novels from *Bojack charter, because these are considered comic books to vampires in this world. Unknowingly to *Todd character, he opens up the dimension that separated the world of the humans and that of magic/fantasy, duh...

He *Todd has nowhere left to go because exiled by family and through hilarious mishap movie shenanigans meets up with the author of his favorite comic books. 

This is the first time *Bojack character meets up with an actual vampire and at first was a robbery turns into a hilarious meet your hero comic scene (mightve missed out that Todd is now robbing people to get food) 

*Todd characters Vampire family is considered a great brood, because within this world the vampires have longer lives and small progeny but *Todds family is considered the guardian type as they are the family that produces the most offsprings. Two or three at a time, (it aint a lot but its honest work) per couple, (yeah gonna keep them monogamous for now), *Todds parents generation was gifted with 7 offsprings but they all inherited a greater power than he (does he have latent power no, he does not, this it, he gets stronger through every fight tho). 

*Bojack (i need to make names) character has always had some gift of stamina and agility. He has not used these to their full potential and have been using them wrongly (doing the nasty, but the ladies were not complaining). After his many flops and an unsuccessful career. He leaves his apartment to live at his familys old estate, which has since been torn down. He finds a five story hostel now taking its place. The place is shabby and old and because the new owner used to be friends with his grandfather offers him a nice discount in one of the best rooms in the building which he cant wait to accept. 

They meetup at the hotel have a fight, a trinket that *Bojack carried wit hb him from his late grandfather protects him and....few weeks later they are suddenly living together and each one is paying half rent. Ill patch it up better but thats it for nwo. Sorry, those are my two cents, let me know how you think OP.
