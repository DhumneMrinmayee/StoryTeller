So I (42 Male Warlord Supreme One in all Manners) wiped out an entire town of puny humans because my wife (35 Woman) said that she wanted a nice place to settle down in and now her, the Supreme Council and my family are saying that ITA.   
My Wife comes to me and says she wants a nice quiet place to settle down to have our baby ( Male Warlord Supreme One in Some Manners II) who is expected soon. I sent out my minions to find a nice place and they found a few. Some of them were too close to enemy territory and some of them were a little too rowdy for my liking. But we found the perfect town in \[Redacted\]. 

  
I showed it to my wife, she walked around , met the people explored the shops and she loved it. A perfect place for Warlord Supreme One in Some Manners II to be raised in. So I got to making the preparations, and my minions and I went out and slaughtered the whole town. Now I’ve expanded my domain and created a lovely space for my son to be born in.   
But my Wife says that it was completely unnecessary to kill all the people there and that we could have just “lived among them” .

  
I told her she was being ridiculous and she was crazy if she thought that I the Supreme one in All Manners was going to live amongst the trash. She then got more upset because she’s also human and thinks now that I think she’s trash. I told her no, she is carrying the next Supreme, her purpose is very important. She’s much more important than the other human trash.   
Thats when she burst into tears and wrote letters to her folks telling them all of what I’d done. She hadn’t talked to me in a few days and then the letters came back from her family saying that I am an Asshole for trying to create the perfect home for our family and telling my Wife she’s important. 

  
I don’t think I did anything wrong here, so I write this letter to you all, Am I the Asshole ?
