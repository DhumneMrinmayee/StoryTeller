"It's broken."

I looked at the old man and sighed. "It's not broken... you have to swish and drag your hand like this."

"Back in my day, we didn't have to swish and drag. We had good old fashioned wands and we were grateful for them!" he grumbled as he tried adjusting his Magika Glove.

"Wands are slow and awkward, Grandpa. Gloves are faster and you don't have to worry about pulling it out of it's case when you need it quickly." I took a breath and tried to push down my frustration. "Let's try it again. Focus your mind on the candle, *swish* and *draaag*."

The candle's wick gently caught on fire, the flame growing stronger as I dragged my hand through the air.

"See? Simple!" I smiled at my grandfather encouragingly. "You can do it, you're a Grandmaster Water Magic Lord. You've overcome harder things before."

The old man let out an audible *harumph* but turned back to the candle and tried again. The flame sparked to life but quickly went out.

"Argh... I told you, this damn thing is broken!" He exclaimed angrily. "I'm calling the company to give them a piece of my mind! Where's my wand?"

I felt a moment of comradery with the poor agent who will take his call and wished them the patience to get through it. Sitting down heavily on the couch, I watched my grandfather search for his misplaced wand and smiled to myself. He could have gone to one of his grandmaster friends to teach him fire magic but instead he called me. Despite the frustration of trying to teach him more modern tech, I enjoyed the time I spent with him.

"WHERE'S THAT BLASTED WAND?!"

I shook my head and chuckled as I stood. "Come on, Grandpa, I'll help you look."
