Confident in his victory, the Demon laughed a terrible laugh such as never heard before or will be since. 

"Egogogogogogo! Egogogogogogo! EGOGOGOGOGOGO!"

Our heroine, Mika, can only smile as she watched in anticipation. She tried to hold her own laugh in, hoping not to give the game to early. 

"I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I? RESISTANCE IS FUTILE! I AM ALL-POWERFUL! ALMIGHTY! NO MAN CAN KILL ME! EGOGOGOGOGOGO!"

Now it's time. 

Mika smiled, her head hung ever so slightly down. "And I told you, didn't I?" Her neck snapped suddenly, her eyes locked on the demon's neck. "I am no man!"

In a split-second, Mika has traveled behind the Demon, sword firmly in hand. 

The Demon's eyes was filled in shock and disbelief, feeling the soft feathers of the heroine's wings. 

It was finished in a single stroke. The Demon's head rolled on the ground and the victory is decided. 

Mika let out a laugh - a more normal but equally disturbing one - to signify the satisfaction of one of her desires: to reveal to an overconfident opponent that she is much more powerful than they can comprehend. 

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
