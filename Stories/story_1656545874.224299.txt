It was funny at this point. Sure the first few threw me for a loop, how could my best friend and finest sniper in the world fail? Well as they say a little digging goes a long way! Clark was Superman how it had taken anyone this long is anyones guess he wasn’t exactly subtle and quite the creature of habit. 


Now where it got interesting was when I told my boss, turns out he knew too! It was a prank played on all new team leaders give us an unkillable target and see what we come up with. Which is where we put together a new prank. We had this group of hot shots stupid kids who wanted to be James Bond and somehow had the skill to do it too. It’s been three weeks and they’ve still not figured it out. They’re getting pretty desperate and I and the boss had to veto a few that were way too extreme.


Figure we’ll give it another month before we pull them off the case should cool their egos a bit. For now I stand to make $80 if none of them figure it out.
