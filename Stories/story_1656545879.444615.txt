**The Rising King**

Once upon a time, -wait no it was actually today- I was interrupted by a voice.“But you can’t just flap around like that”, the voice echoed throughout the hallway.“Yes I can” I replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “I’m a fairy.”“No, no what I mean, you can’t flap around LIKE THAT”, the human attempted at wiggling his behind in a manner befitting only the fairies.“I think you misunderstood.” I grinned. “I can, and you,” I paused for a dramatic second, “YOU CAN TOO!”Waving my magic wand towards him, the doors into the ballroom opened and he went flying in butt first as a wiggling bee.“COMING THROUGH — THE FART EXPRESS!” I screamed at the top of my lounges and waved my arms towards the butt with the attached human. The swinging butt started making several huge farting noises to the express discontent of the owner of the butt, at least based on his very red chins and screaming voice.“What do you say kids, is it time?!” I did my famous line as the butt was now flying in circles around the chandelier, casting a giant butt shadow on the walls.“YESSSSS IT’S TIME!” all the children laughed, pointed and screamed at the top of their lounges. Actually all the voices in the room were screaming “Yes”, in one way or the other. All but(t) one! It distinctly tried to scream something else, but was sadly drowned by the roar of yes’s chanting. Waving my wand, the flying butt exploded like a balloon animal and candy came out of it and landed all over the room. The boy was fine of course, it was all an illusion, making it rain candy.“I’ll remember this, I’ll tell my father… The K-K-King!” His voice was drowned in the laughing echoes of children enjoying their birthday party - and their favourite entertaining fairy - me. I flew away from the ballroom with a smile as all the children chanted “Goodbye Mr. Menace!“

As I flew home, I remembered the most important Fairy Law.\*“§3. Thou shall never invite party poopers to your fairy balls or events. If they do show up, they can’t go next time and shall be ridiculed throughout the party's duration!”\*Luckily it was a happy day of happy kids, and one strike of Fairy Law. Well I guess he won’t be coming to our next party!

Now, three weeks later I was checking my mailbox. I even waited outside for the mailman before he arrived. “IS it there today!?” I yelled at him before he was even at my house."Hold your horses, Mr. Rising, I’ll check when I get to your house”. Several moments of impatiently tapping the ground passed by as he delivered his mail. He dragged his feet to the bike before he put his hand into the bag… aaaand… I held my breath.“I apologise Mr. Rising, but there appears to be no letters addressed to you today.”“Are you sure?!” I waved my magical wand in frustration, knowing well that I shouldn’t use it outside arranged hoaxes or wartime. Not believing him, I popped my head straight down into the mailbag to find my invitation.“The invitation to the Kings ball! It’s got to be in here!” I popped my head out of the bag realising I should be talking to the postman instead of the bag. “It HAS to be!”“Ahem, Mr. Rising Menace, I would appreciate it if you keep your head out of my bag,” he added with a slightly harsher but very strict tone, “please.”“But… “, I said as my heart sank deeper. Then it clicked.“I’m not invited”, as I said it, it dawned on me what had happened three weeks ago - and what might have led to me not being invited at all. The words of the butt-boy echoed in my mind. “... I’ll tell my father… The K-K-King”. The crowning of the King’s Son was tomorrow and I had not gotten an invitation. Me, the greatest entertainer of fairies and the diplomatic representative of fairyland. The latter had something to say, the first was just my part time “job” as the humans called it. If I can’t be invited, then I’ll invite myself, it is written in the law.

Strangely enough, the humans didn’t know about this law, but they should have had. And by tomorrow, they most definitely would know the law of the fairies.\*“§42.a Thou shall never, not invite a fairy that wants to be invited, to any feast or event of a certain magnitude of more than 5 attendees, if such a fairy wants to be invited.”*I checked in the Fairy Law, and it was right there, and it even had a section 42.b*“§42.b If thou break the law of 42.a, the fairy has the right to crash the party and do whatever they want to do, without harm to any younglings.”\*Younglings was the word Fairy Law used to describe anyone that wasn’t an adult. This was perfect for my plan. The King hadn’t invited me, so he needed a lesson. And by the law of fairies of course, the younglings still would have fun!

I peeked over the edge of the organ pipe, trying desperately not to laugh already because that would break my invisibility. “Time to steal the show.” I whispered to organ pipes.\~PAM PAM PAAAAAAAM\~The heaviest notes from the organ rang on my command, deafening the priest's attempts to speak. As the last wave of sound came through the pipes I rode them out chuckling to match its tone. All the kids chimed in on a perfect pitch, “Ooooooohhhh”.The echo of “Menace-, Menace!”, chanted by a children's choir in the heavenly halls, was about as perfect as I could’ve hoped for the start of the crowning of the King’s Son.“I see that thee all have gathered here today for the truly miracululululululous wonders that will be performed…” I paused dramatically as the children stopped chanting and while their parents covered their mouths in shock.“By … yours… truly…. Meeeee\~!” I chuckled with profoundly perfectly piped pitched support from the organ. The children cheered and the parents growned.“What do you say kids, is it time?!”“Menace, Menace, Menace!” They chanted it three times exactly. My lucky number.Replying to the echoes I yelled “YESSSSS IT’S TIME!”“And you all will need my magical gifts!!” Another wiggly wand wave supported by jiggly music made the enchanted glasses appear on everyone’s head.Of course to the parents it looked like gold winged glasses. To children however, they were all colours of the rainbow and made everything they saw sparkly. It was like any other time when adults and children get together, the highly magical world of a child and the boring or frightening truth of adulthood. I chose to make sure the parents only would see the latter today, they could thank the King in advance.

The King stood up, shouting at the top of his lounges. “BE GONE”, his voice echoed like a viking roaring over the seas.“Tut tut tut…” I shook my head in disapproval and suddenly the roar's pitch turned the same way the wind does to a vikings ship. It went from the sound of a storming roar to the squeak of the tiniest of mice.“Beee gonnee”, he was now the king of Mice. Not only in voice, but the king himself shrunk in size, to half that of a mouse. He even outgrew his own crown. The crown had imprisoned the squeaky king. Angrily he clawed and bonked on the side of the golden crown.Next to the king came three little mice, and they danced around him in a circle and bowed.“The King is now the king of Mice! Squeek to the king!” All the children cheered and chanted.“Squeek to the king!” The three mice bowed to the king and everytime the king tried to escape, their tails would slap his fingers and he would tumble down the edge of his crown.
