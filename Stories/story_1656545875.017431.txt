I immediately look around.

'Whos there?', i call out.

'God? is that you?', silence.

'So... is this like a three wishes type deal or what?', still no response, i guess i needed to make statements to make things happen.

I decided to test a few things out. 

Through experimentation, my apartment was now filled with yellow rubber ducks. Of all shapes and sizes, For science.

I found that whatever i verbalised would come true, no matter how specific.

I got a litte giddy, but i calmed myself. It'd be dangerous if i got careless and people found out.
I don't wanna dr manhattan on their ass. 

Remaim calm and collected, whats the best thing to do right now?

First i got rid of the rubber ducks, 'Remove all the rubber ducks in this room'

I needed to pee. as i came out of the toilet, an interesting annoucement caught my ear.

'CNN Deborah here, reporting on the mysterious phonemon of rubber ducks vanishing into thin air'

I blinked once, twice. Hold up

So when I said 'room', it meant to say the world was my room. damn what a chad, i say to myself.
