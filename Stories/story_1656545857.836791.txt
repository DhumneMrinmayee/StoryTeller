*I can’t believe I missed this.* 

The Dragon Knight, Darrig, strode down the familiar country hillside, where giant hornets once plagued the farmlands. *You’re welcome,* he said to himself. When he first came to this strange land, this was where he started to make a name for himself. Small quests, trivial chores; the baby steps that made him a squire.

But he had missed one. Finding a cat, *a feline*, of all things. It became known to him whilst he was cleaning his shelf of mementos, and a tiny scroll with the Q sigil rolled onto the ground. It instantly transported his mind back to the day he picked it up. A frightened farmer lost his cat and would do anything to get him back. 

*Cats freak me out.* In earlier times, they were fiercely wild. And then it became normal to domesticate them. And they shat in their owners homes as recompense. 

But, he couldn’t leave it uncompleted. The faster it was done, the faster the burden of his unsatisfactory quest log would disappear. 

He never actually visited the farmer’s home, so he had to knock on some doors until he recognized the farmer in question. 

He looked distressed, as there were scratches all over his face. “Well well, look what the cat dragged in. You’re mighty late.”

“I’m uh… really sorry about that. I got in over my head.” The knight couldn’t stop staring at his bleeding face.

“I have a new request-“ a cabinet full of glasswares fell to the ground, the shattering sound causing the knight to flinch. 

The farmer, though, was stoically determined. “….please kill the bastard.”
