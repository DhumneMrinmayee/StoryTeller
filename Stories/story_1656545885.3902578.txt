AITA for cursing an infant?

Listen, I know it sounds bad, but I, (42F) am a Fairy queen. It's a widely known public affair, the birth of a princess, and invitations are sent to the whole kingdom. I was explicitly NOT invited, so fairy law dictates that I not only show up, but curse the infant for the insult. If I didn't do it, I would have ceased to exist and the balance of the world would have been ruined. So I showed up, and cursed the princess to dye on her 16th birthday after touching a spinning needle. I didn't think they'd take it as in death, though I think my wording was off. I meant dye her hair. My bad. 

Why I might be TA- I suppose I could have worded my curse better. Or chosen something like she'd be clumsy her whole life. I was angry, and fairy law was up my butt about it. 


Update: they destroyed every spinning needle in the kingdom and sent her away to live her life in the woods. So I may have really messed up now. People are cursing my name and I think they really misinterpreted my curse.
