I do not hate this kingdom.  
I don’t hate the people in it, I don’t hate the customs, the traditions, the culture, any of it.  
I do, however, hate the royal family. Or at least, the king and the queen. They are getting on in years, and they are increasingly contrarian to the winds of change and time and progress, winds that other kingdoms seem more than able to ride, winds that the people of this very kingdom would be more than happy to ride were it not for its leaders being so… stuck.  
And as a fae of the wind, I know a thing or two about this sort of thing.  
That said, I definitely don’t hate the baby they’re christening at this party. Like, it’s a baby! It doesn’t necessarily have to turn out the same way its dumb, stupid, regressive parents.  
However, due to custom, it is the child I must curse to demonstrate a lesson to the family, and to the kingdom at large, about respecting the fae kind. Rather backwards in a way, but I do see why the law is the way it is… however, I have an idea.  
I am going to give this child a… special, symbolic curse. A curse that will definitely make its life harder at first, but one that should help in the long run… help in a way that the masses will come to live, that that old fop will positively despise~…
