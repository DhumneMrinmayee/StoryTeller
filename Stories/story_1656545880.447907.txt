"You know, for a species as... well... unsophisticated as they are, human spaceships are some of the safest I've ever been on."

"It's because they're soft, Yorblon." The aged Captain of the Zeb-zeb Ambassador Crew ran a clawed hand over his carapace and clicked his pincers in disapproval as he scuttled down the hallway of the Armstrong 800. "No shells, no exoskeletons, no carapaces or scales. Why, even their bones may as well be hollow with how easily they break." The Captain paused to turn at his crewmate. "Did you know, Yorblon, that a human can easily bite off another human's finger because it is about as soft as a raw carrot?"

Yorblon held back a gag. He'd eaten raw carrots before at cultural exchange feasts and would rather not think about human fingers should he ever do it again.

"I am certain the wireworking in these walls is also as simple as they are." The Captain nudged a fuse box as if the hollow clank would prove his point. Yorblon wasn't so sure. The Captain may have been present at all the formal ceremony, but it was he and the other lower-ranking members of the Ambassador Crew that had to mingle and work with the primate-class beings in less-than-ideal situations. The humans had proven their cleverness and tenacity time and time again. 

"They're pathetic in every way, really. I suppose I'll have to dumb down the treaty speech I'd prepared..."

If only he could convince the Captain of that before they reached the humans' own Ambassador Crew three doors down.
