The King seldom critiques demons who make good work or singles out demons who do poorly. It's the first time he's done so.

“The Gods would drink this like water. Not even a blister. If you want to be a Godslayer and one day the King of the Malevolents, this is pathetic.”

“Dad. “ I called out.

“Do you feel nothing”

“Yes. Why?”

"Nothing. At all”. The King knitted his eyebrows in impatience.

“This is the poison that supposedly killed mother. “

With rising tensions, the temperature of the chamber rose.

“I got it from the prisoner whom you convicted of murder. She didn’t die of poison. Did she? Dad…”

The King gave one look at his guards who were scurrying their way out of the room. “Daughter… Listen to me. She was our enemy. “

“She loved us!” I yelled as I throwing the remaining wine from my glass.

“Peace! Her idea was to form a treaty with the Gods”, he continued ignorant of what he had done.

One look and I knew the same was going to happen to me. I need to disappear . And so I did taking with me the knowledge to kill the Gods.
