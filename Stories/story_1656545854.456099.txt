“Why aren’t you scared? I’m a vampire- I could kill you!”  
  
“So could literally every other human, you’re not special.”  
  
“…Sorry?”  
  
“No, it’s just like, ahhh, I get it, you’re scary and all, but so is living, you know? So is driving a foot away from a 10-ton steel box going 80 kilometers.”   
  
“Well, yeah, I mean, but we get in cars every day, and nothing happens, right? I mean, I don’t, I fly everywhere, you know, as a bat,” he spreads his hands out like wings, “but still.”  
  
“Yeah, you’re probably more worried about planes sucking you up, or-“  
  
“Geese! Geese are the worst!”  
  
“Really?”  
  
“Yes, you’d think they’d mind their business, but no, the fuckers do NOT leave us alone!”  
  
“Right, but isn’t it not a big deal? I mean, you’re immortal.”  
  
He looks around conspiratorially, and says “Look, I shouldn’t tell you this, but immortality sucks ass. Have you ever gotten sucked into an industrial fan, and re-animated from the biggest chunk remaining?”  
  
He blinks and is silent for a few seconds. “God, no.”  
  
“And you are aware of it every single second, just how small you are, just how helpless and incomplete you are.”  
  
“Huh. Well, I learned something today.”  
  
“And what is that?”  
  
“Being a vampire su-“ The vampire rips into his throat, the pun dying in his gurgling mouth.
