IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR ALL SCP FOUNDATON PERSONNEL

It all started when Dr. Bright leaked some files containing details on SCP - (Data Expunged) and SCP - (Data Expunged) on a website named 4chan. The O5 council scrambled to release a worm into the website, in an attempt to find and eradicate any instance of the files. But the damage was done.

There was only one option left. Activate protocol *Internet*. Protocol *Internet* was a last ditch attempt at causing disillusion surround the SCP Foundation. Once initiated, a website was created containing all files on the SCP within the foundations servers, as well as information on all major/important personnel. The last step was to make sure that the entire world viewed the entire website as fictional stories written by anonymous authors.

Protocol *Internet* has been deemed a success by the O5 council, and will remain in place until further notice.

\- Dr. (Data Expunged)  


Post Script;

Can someone on the IT team please make sure this announcement does not get released to the public? The hard work done by Dr. {Data Missing}, in an attempt to convince the public of the SCP Foundation being fiction, would go to waste if this announcement found it's way to the public
