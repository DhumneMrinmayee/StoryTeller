AITA for making a deal with a princess and not apologizing to her family for doing what she asked me to do?

I (96F) live in an underwater cave on the outskirts of a kingdom. One day, the youngest princess came to me and asked me to make her a potion that will allow her to have human legs. I told her that there was a way for her to get legs, but I warned her that every step would feel like she was walking on knives, that she would never see her family again. I also warned her that if she couldn't get her prince to fall in love with her, she would never have a human soul, and if he marries another woman, her heart would break and she would be nothing more than seafoam. Despite all this, she insisted that this is what she wanted. 

In return, I only asked for her lovely voice. At this, she seemed a little skeptical, but in the end she accepted anyway. I even waited to cut out her tongue until AFTER I finished the potion and gave it to her.

Turns out, the prince didn't fall in love with her and he married another. When her sisters found out, they came to me and asked for something to turn her back into a mermaid. I was annoyed, but obliged with their requests in exchange for their beautiful hair. I gave them a dagger that will turn the youngest back into a mermaid if she kills the prince and lets his blood drip onto her feet.

When the time came for her to kill the prince, she couldn't do it so she turned into seafoam. Her family is now enraged with me and are demanding an apology, but I only did what they wanted. I don't see how her death was my fault and if they had paid more attention to her, she never would've developed this unhealthy obsession with this guy she just met.

So AITA?
