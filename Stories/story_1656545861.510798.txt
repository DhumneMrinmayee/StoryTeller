My alarm is ringing.
It's ringing really freaking loudly. 
I just want to sleep. I reach for it as a reflex. It's not there not in the usual place at least. That's when my drunk-ass brain realized : the alarm is ringing? Aren't we supposed to be scrambled by a meteor today? My alarm is my iPhone there is no way it survived, it can't survive the pavement. How did I survive? Well survive is a big word, I'm alive but I sure don't feel like it. This was the first and last time I try alcohol. As I stood up from my bed with a headache that would incite me to do otherwise I reach the window.
 Sure enough the neighborhood was wrecked. I wonder if there is anyone without a hangover right now? I grab a half empty pizza box and a water bottle and get out of a house. Not sure where I am must have had fun. I remember a guy with megaphone singing Disney lyrics off key last time I was somewhat sober, I wonder if it's still around. After enough time to finish the bottle and the pizza I finally found the megaphone, not the guy tho, I wonder if he is ok. I turn it on, at first I just wanted to say a big good morning but my time of searching allowed me to think of a better speech. "Hey everybody, slept well? Me neither. Now I believe we can all agree that we collectively went a bit overboard last week it's to a point I'm surprised nobody try to set of nukes. But I think that since we got to empty our baggages it would be a good time to start over right? The world was a bit shit before all that remember? Well let's try again shall we? I don't believe a single government is still holding so let's switch it up a bit. Capitalism fucked up big time and we all know it. I propose we try the ol communism, but this time we try to not have a tyrant as a governor okay? "
-"ghaaa! "
I'm not sure if the groans are them agreeing or telling me to shut up because it's to early. But I still hope that they agree that since it all went to shit we're better of if we flush it all.
