It's my first writing and english is not my native language, so, sorry for any inconveniences.

I don't know what came to me that day. It was a joyful day and everyone was celebrating and yet, I had this itchy feeling that didn't went away no matter what. I didn't know what to do to stop it while watching the festival and the parade. 

The war with planet 01689-B was over, and embassadors from both planets were at the procession, where the signing of peace treaty was finally taking place. While I watched floats pass in the middle of the crowd, the car were peace were about to be signed crossed in front of me, and that's when I saw it. The creature I hated so much watching them in TV, those who we all despised so much until then, were attracting me like a moth to a candle. Their noses were a gigantic red ball that reflected light like a glass of wine and the president, who was about to sign, had the biggest of them all.

I don't know what overcame me, I could not touch that big red juicy nose, my hole body was screaming me to boop it, to discover what texture it was like and maybe the taste of that ball. Was it like strawberry? Maybe something salty. That's what I was feeling all day, that itches, I knew that if I touch that, I would feel better.

The next thing I remembered, a dozen of guns were pointing at me and I was over the president, drooling over that big nose. I couldn't stop myself, I boop it...




-The peace treaty is broken and embassadors from planet 01689-B had declared war to our planet again.
