Not knowing how long it would last, I'd immediately "call" the following, in order:

I call for world peace, effective immediately. All war ends RIGHT NOW. All soldiers drop their weapons, and go home to their families. Those responsible for war crimes are arrested and will face trials.

I call for an end to all poverty, pollution, disease, and world hunger; Universal Basic Income starts immediately, empty homes are given to the homeless, renters now own their home, mortgages vanish, and taxes end for anyone making less than a million dollars per year. All worker wages triple, CEO pay is slashed, Billionaires are abolished (taxes make this amount impossible)  and all jobs now include profit sharing. Plant and animal life immediately becomes more plentiful worldwide, especially produce which now blooms and grows everywhere that's practical, and global climate is restored circa 300 years ago.  


If all this comes to pass, I'd make one final call: Will the one responsible for my Omnipotence speak with me, willingly?
