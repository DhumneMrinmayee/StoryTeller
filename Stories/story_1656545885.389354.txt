AITA for not paying my hired henchman?

So I (45f) hired a henchman from our local guild for protective services a few years back. It's been a pretty good relationship over all, but to be honest there hasn't been much to do for many years.

Recently though an issue came up and I directed the hired help to execute a task. I thought I was exceptionally clear - take this usurper into the forest, execute and bring back the heart as proof (I've heard of others who didn't ask for proof and it's caused problems). 

Dude comes back with a heart and everything's great.

Then, the next day I find out that this person wasn't executed and now I'm running around all over the freaking forest trying to do this myself while I ALSO have a kingdom to run. I was furious but I didn't have time to make a fuss because I  ended up having to make an entire poisoned apple just to finish this issue off.

Now the local Henchman Guild is suing for breach of contract because this hired help somehow disappeared on his way home last night and I'm refusing to pay his last paycheck since services weren't rendered.

Am I the asshole for insisting on quality service?
