It had gotten to a point in my walking where I was giving up seeing around the hill. All of the houses I had passed through had been useless. Once I realized that all the furniture and food inside was plastic, I knew I had to find a way out.

My stomach was growling, and all I could hear was the slow ticking of the place. The machinery powering this place always seemed like it was in the distance yet right in front of me. Each white house with another bright red roof threatened to send me to my grave. 

The path before me seemed endless. It eventually got to me. I started kicking one of the houses and the wall before me began bending.

“Let me the Hell out!” I shouted.

I pretty much ripped the door off in frustration and began jumping on the floor. The fake hardwood below me started caving in. I didn’t even care if there was a hole underneath, I wanted out of this place.

On one of my jumps, I broke through the floor and felt my stomach drop as I was plunged into darkness. I hit the ground hard like I had fallen on pavement. My head throbbed in pain, and I groaned as I got myself up. 

At first I saw nothing, but then my vision slowly made things brighter. I saw something that looked like a person. I nearly screamed as I realized the person was me and that they were dead. As I panicked and looked around, I saw there were more bodies that looked like me. Before my vision faded, I saw one last detail about the bodies.

They all had “experiment failed” written on them followed by a number. How long had I been here, and for what purpose?
