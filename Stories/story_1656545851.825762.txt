*My name is Gekokujo. The press likes to shorten this name to Kujo for simplicity’s sake, and because of their lack of respect for foreign language, but I honestly don’t mind. I’m here to succeed in a goal, not amass fame and fortune for myself, after all.  
This society is imbalanced. Pitiful, selfish weaklings bully the strong of will, the strong of character, and those strong ones submit. This world has all of the wrong priorities, the wrong foci, the wrong means and ends. It is an imbalanced world, headed for destruction of one kind or another, and I LOATHE the blind, dumb masses, ignorant by their own choice, that support it.  
This is where I get my name. In Japanese tradition, a Gekokujo refers to an inversion of society. The people on the bottom overthrowing the people on the top. Gekokujo is rebellion. Gekokujo is revolution. I am Gekokujo.  
Recently I have been dealing with a certain hero. Her name is Jubilee. Her power isn’t the most unique in the world, but where she draws it from is… nothing short of fascinating to me. As her name implies, the more happy, the more mirthful, the more joyous people around her are… indeed, the more jubilant… the stronger, the faster, the more agile she becomes.  
At first I thought her just another selfish attention whore. Bear in mind, the term “whore” isn’t used due to her femininity, I just… regardless of how old or young, what gender or class, or any of that that someone is, an attention whore is an attention whore. Jubilee’s power, and her adept skill at wowing the masses before her to put it to use, really lend themselves to showmanship and arrogance. That, and my experience with a handful of other heroes, told me all I needed to know about her… or so I thought.*
