I have a condition.

No, it's not mental. Well, not just mental. It's a nervous thing. My nerve receptors are all wrong, and my brain doesn't read the messages correctly. According to my senses, I am constantly in pain.

Thus, everywhere it matters? I am in pain. The brain is a beautiful object you see. Whatever it believes? Happens. As someone smarter once said, the mind can turn heaven into hell and hell into heaven. And for me? Life was hell.

All I knew was pain. All I ever felt was pain. Or nausea. Or discomfort. Even a change in temperature of a couple of degrees was enough to get me all bothered.

The doctors suggested to me a completely isolated and calibrated room. Like those bubble pods they give to children with AIDS. But that shit is too expensive. And no surgery exists such that it can right all the wrong in your receptors. 

So in the end all I had to deal with my illness was opioids and prayers.

I dropped them both off quick. Opioids were too addictive, and made everything so hazy I felt like I was sleepwalking. The relief was immense but man, looking at the conditions of addicts in America? I'm glad I made that call.

As for prayer, it never did anything. My parents sure tried, they did everything for me that they could each Sunday to get me clean and well dressed and not shrieking in pain for church. But it never worked for me. I mean... No prayer took the pain away. 

Besides, wasn't I a creation of God in the first place? Why would the capital G fix what he only broke?

That's how I found myself roaming the streets of my almost deserted town sunday morning, smoking a joint. Weed worked good. But despite the fact I had a medical card, I didn't really smoke because of my parents. It just did feel right to them. But that's why I enjoyed smoking, because the pain relief made me able to do things. I could walk! Without feeling crippling pressure on top of the pain!

I found myself in a unknown street. Funny. I've lived here all my life. What's unknown to me?

As I search for clues that will tell me the location, I see a sign.

Depressed? Anxious? Unhappy?” The sign shouted at me, “Why not become an amorphous entity and shirk the confines of time and space? Embrace your Eldritch Nature today!

Eldritch. I know that word. One of the benefits of free time in bed is reading a lot. Eldritch is Lovecraft. Cathu-lyu? Something like that.

There's a number at the bottom. I take out my phone and dial. Its one of the few times I'm calling anyone but ma and pa.

'Hello?'

'Ah, Mr \*\*\*\*\*? We've been expecting you.' A rhythmic voice rasps out.

WTF. They know my name. I've just said hello and they already know my name!

'Don't be alarmed Mr \*\*\*\*\*. It was you who had provided all these details to us. Including the nature of your ailment. May I ask how you're doing today? Sunday, so I'm assuming you're self-medicating, enjoying the respite those few hours of organized brainwashing your parents indulge in give you. Church as they say.'

'Yeah they're at church and- wait. I told you all this? I'm talking to you for the first time! I don't even know who you are!'

'Not to get ahead of ourselves but since you asked Mr \*\*\*\*\*, we here don't deal in time the way you do down there. Suffice it to say it was very much the *entity* of you that gave us this information. Maybe not the you you are currently.

'WHAT!?'

'Hmm, I did get too ahead. No matter. Let me put it in simple terms. What we're offering to you Mr \*\*\*\*\*, is transcendence. You are one of the very few select people in the world with the capability and desire to make it through the rigorous process, but we have faith in you.

'Transcendence? Like a monk?'

'No. Transcendence, like a God.'

I am silent. The words are too heavy. I need time to absorb them. The hypnotic voice on the other end continues.

'This call is no coincidence. Neither was you reading the sign. And neither was, at the risk of alarming you, your condition.'

Something about his words leaves me pale to the bone. Like a king sitting before the oracle of Delphi, listening to the tale of his own demise.

'You Mr \*\*\*\*\* have been ostracized. Not by people, not by the earth, but by your reality itself. Your nervous mal-alingment means you are at a fundamental odds with the realm you occupy, and this will never change no matter what you do. What I'm offering you Mr \*\*\*\*\*, is a chance to leave this all behind.

'I... A...' I actually stutter, for the first time in my life.

Or should I say, it is time to wake up my friend. Leave R'Lyeh behind and awaken!'

As the voice says that, thunder strikes out of nowhere. The street I am on seems to grow in size and power. The sky darkens and for some reason I find in me a fear I have not known ever in my life. I drop my phone on the spot and run, the residual high and the fear letting me go past the barriers put by my condition.

As I run, I hear emanating from the dropped phone a sinister laugh, the laugh of a madman who knows he has won. It follows me all the way home...

THE END.
