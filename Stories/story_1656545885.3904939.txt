AITA For levelling a nearby settlement?

Before you judge let me give you some context. Me, (1500 Elder Lich). The town in question is on land that belonged to me until the Grand Alliance forcefully took it 500 years ago and the champions hurt me enough it took 500 years to reform out of my phylactery. 

The place isn't special in a sense of resources, but it was an orc town where me and my old dread council buddies(who are now gone thanks to the fight) would have war meetings and keep in touch you know? So, after reforming, I reformed the crew, took some blood and violence, but it worked out.

Now, I was reasonable, we kidnapped the a noble and sent his head with our envoy to the head of the town as a formal request to vacate the illegally aquired property. I even gave them till sunrise the next day! And what do they do? They kill the envoy and string them up at the town entrance and a note declaring that they would not yield.

So, one thing led to another and now the town is levelled and occupants are dead for not honouring my request. Me being a Lich raised all the dead townsfolk and have them rebuild my property. It's going fine but some pesky knight from the Grand Alliance just came and declares that they will wipe us out for our evil actions! I am appalled by their disrespectful attitude. It shocked me how little manners people this century have.

TLDR; Property stolen illegally by local alliance, lawful notice of eviction was ignored, the tenants were removed forcefully, now local alliance wishes to steal more property and threatened violance. 

So, that said AITA?
