The Adventurer grinned to themselves mirthfully as they approached the farm house. A simple task, nostalgic really? A harkened callback to the long-gone days when it wasn't about evil necromancers or planar deities or corrupt lords inciting insurrection. When it was just him, the open road, and an old man with a lost kitten.

He approached the bark where the kitten was last seen, only to hear a deep throaty growl from within. In the sliver of light leaking through the barn door he saw orange and black strips, on a pay bigger than his head. Of course. Of course the kind old man had actually been harboring a tiger, not a housecat. The adventurer laughed quietly to himself, thinking of how terrible this fight would have been back when he was a simple D-Rank. But he was far too highly leveled and drastically overgeared for this sort of encounter right now. The tiger posed no meaningful challenge.

The Adventurer entered the barn, and immediately noticed two things. The first thing he noticed was the other tigers. A **LOT** of tigers; the lost foundling must have returned to his pride. The second thing he noticed was a flash of light and a booming voice:

"This encounter is below your Adventurer Level. Level Sync will now be engaged."
