Lucia took a deep breath while joining her hands together, maybe her daughter's cult was just a harmless  one or even just a prank on her priestess mother. Só the woman put on a smile before nodding "alright...what is it a cult of? Dioritis, the god of parties?"

Erina, the 20 years old college student shook her head before smiling brightly, excited to share more about her new cult. "Nope! It is a cult to Relana!"

The priestess of astra, goddess of light, didnt recgonise the name right away, though it did feel familiar...worringly só. "Relana? What...would they be a deity of?"

"Oh,no no no. Relana is no god. Relana is...more than that haha..." The daughter began to say, trying to find the proper words to explain. "Relana is...a feeling of sorts, more than a deity, but less than an actual being, she is someone that brings joy to all that meet them! Here, let me show you!" Then her finger would have begun to glow before she quickly touched the middle of Lucia's forehead before she could react.

When her daughter touched her, the priestess felt a combination of feelings she couldnt properly describe, something more joyous than happiness, something more chilling than terror...something more confusing than love. When it was over she looked at her daughter with a different gaze than normal, for some reason her child seemed to now emanate an aura of leadership, of charisma, of...control. "w-what...what is going on?" Lucia would have said, her vision starting to become a bit blurry

The daughrer smiled a bit criptly before nodding, her childlike voice changing to a more charming tone, though also one that carried heavy secrets behind it. "Dont worry ex-priestess of Astra, i shall take good care of you, soon you will also join me wholeheartdly like your daughter."
