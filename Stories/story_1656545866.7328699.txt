It had been sixteen hours or so, she thought to herself, trying to remember just how long it had been since she opened her eyes here. Slowly inhaling, she remembered three days ago she had went hiking, brook babbling at her feet, every inch around her crawling with life, quiet forest creatures and wind were deafening compared to here, this prison and place of nothing where she'd found herself trapped.

Gears spun and worked to provide light, heat to the stove and the birds that warbled, mute past the plastic kitchen windows, the stray cat with the strange springwork walk, that had walked up the street once then disappeared around the corner. 

She'd tried the doors and windows and none would open, beat her knuckles bloody on the walls, as if to punch through them and nothing gave. Upstairs had lead to two bedrooms, a bathroom, no trap door for an attic. Past the ground floor there was a basement door, but instead of an earthen space it was more plastic, and stairs, gears, spiraling down, down, until she could see nothing but darkness. She'd tried jamming one of them just to see what happened, but it sliced through the shoe she'd stuffed in like butter, and she sobbed into her aching, battered hands. 

She was so thirsty. Hunger wasn't even a thought in her mind. The taps when turned were still dry, the toilets empty, save for a plastic layer meant to model water. Her lips were dry and she chewed at a dry piece of skin, caught it between her teeth and pulled. It bled, and she ran through the attempts she'd taken for the hundredth time to escape, racked her mind for any other alternatives and found nothing else to try. 

...

It had been thirty eight hours. She was pretty sure she had broken her second and third knuckles, but it wasn't like it mattered. She lay, half slumped against the wall and wondered just what had she done to deserve this, who had she wronged so badly to be trapped, forgotten, left to die in this plastic cage. How had they done it, she asked herself. How had all traces of organic life been erased here, how was this so complete, so seamless? 

...

Fifty three hours. 

...

Nearly sixty she guessed. She knew she didn't have much longer. She could tell she wasn't thinking clearly, like something was jamming her thoughts, like a log in a river. Her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth and her eyes were hard to keep open. Everything, every inch of her body ached. Every muscle cramped and wouldn’t relax. She'd screamed herself hoarse hours ago and tears wouldn’t form any longer. 

Like a mouse trapped in an empty cabin sealed for the season, she'd finally accepted her fate and had lay with her back and legs parallel to the wall, her head propped on one of her arms. She wished she'd have had the foresight to cut herself and write with the blood on the walls. To spite her captor. To leave a message. Anything. To die here like this, though, was enough. She would spoil and fester like meat in shrink-wrap, and when her murderer bothered to come back, they'd be floored with the smell and sight of her. She hoped it would leave a lasting memory.

She waited now for the end, she would embrace it when the time came, anything but this. She closed her eyes and slept. 

...

She opened her eyes and realized immediately something was off. She couldn't remember how she'd gotten here, but it was strangely quiet, and everything smelled of plastic. As she roamed the house, every door was locked and the only thing organic here, in this house, in this world was her...
