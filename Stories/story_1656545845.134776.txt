I didn't move a muscle in the moments following the failure of a plan that my twin brother, King David II, had elucidated for every dinner guest to witness. Instead, my eyes gazed off to the furthest picture frame on the wall. A royal portrait of my deceased parents as King and Queen of Ayoria, cradling my brother and I in their arms, hung so neatly at the foot of the grand foyer staircase. They say that pictures speak a thousand words, but every word spoken from that painting could not have been more wrong. For as long as David was king, the royal family's image had lost any and every ounce of class and majesty. Violence had consumed the kingdom, with our very own armored knights overpowering civilians and punishing them for falsified offenses. I even felt great remorse for the peasants that were arriving by the dozens at the front gates of the castle, wailing out for protection from the very kingdom that oversees and denies their well-being. I didn't want to kill him, but it was my duty to take the throne back to continue my parent's legacy of peace and prosperity among Ayorian civilization, no matter what lengths I had to go to. If poison wasn't going to take David to the grave, something was and I made sure of it.  


Note: This is brief, just a rundown of a possible plot idea. It's kind of ironic in the sense of the main character wanting peace but achieving it with murder... I tried :P
