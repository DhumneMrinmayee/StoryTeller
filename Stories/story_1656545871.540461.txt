Ash glances over and groans, "Oh great. Not them again." He turns and begins to stand before getting stopped by a half elf mage who says "Don't their not worth your trouble. Plus, Drunes gonna kick them out on her own." 

The two watch from their bar seats as the Ghostly Guild sits down at a table and begins talking among themselves. Ash stares at them, trying to use his perception to find anything of worth on them. Not able to see anything he exhales harshly and turns back to his drink. 

A moment later, a Titan female stands up and walks over to that table. Her voice, rings low as she growls "Out. Of. My. Guilds. Tavern." She stays composed but stares at them "You may have qualified for the morals test but the Guardian guild doesn't trust you quite yet. So out." She moves and looks each of them in the eye before Mimic stands and it's hand shifts into a sword and they lift it to the Titans neck. 

From outside, the house shakes with sounds of explosions and banging of clanging metal before the door is swung open and armor pieces, bones, and a few assorted things lay on the ground. A rattling is heard as the skeleton moves himself back into it's normal form. "Ugh," he mumbles bending to pick up his bow "That's the fourth time this month that a guild head group has beaten us out of their area." The Mimic's body regathers and fixes itself before its higher tone of voice says "True but it's not time yet, the Master has plans for later, we can NOT change the plan." and the hand goes up to stop the skeletons bow. The skeleton shrugs her hand off and says "One day. One day we'll kill them ALL." then he turns and walks away with the rest of his party into the swamp the edges the town.
