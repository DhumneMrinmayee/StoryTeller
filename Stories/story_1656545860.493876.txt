Not again. This is the third time this week that Max has set off a genie lamp. I sigh as I move towards the lamp. “I AM MUSTARAIN THE GREAT AND MIGHTY. I will allow thre-“. The genies voice fades away as he slowly gets absorbed back into the lamp. “Yeah yeah three wishes.”, I retort to myself as I set the lamp back onto the shelf. I turn to max and kneel to his level. “Listen buddy, I know you like the taste of three thousand year old magic, but I can’t sell these lamps if you keep letting them loose.”, I pat his head as I stand up once more. The room is full of thousands of lamps, all of different sizes and shapes. Some red, some blue, some small, and some tall. This shop has been passed down for generations. With my dog max by my side, we’ve helped the greater Bay Area with all the wishes they can buy. And boy can they buy.
