"Um... I don't remember." Her voice drifted off. It seemed Abby was frightened by my approach. Fidgety. And little wonder - I was interrogating her. That was too much for a child.

"Now, that's okay," I said with a softer, sweeter tone, "but I really need to know. Close your eyes and try to remember, sweetie. Okay?"

"It's very important," my mother added.

"Alright. I'll try," said Abby with a reluctant nod. And, for a moment, she did try, for what it was worth. My daughter closed her eyes, tightened her fists, and scrunched her brow. But suddenly, with unnatural spontaneity, she opened her eyes and glanced behind her shoulder to the kitchen. "There's twelve."

"You're sure?"

"Yes. I can count again if you want."

"Count?" Shit. "How tall is Stewie?"

"This height."

"What color is Stewie?"

"Orange."

"Does he have horns?"

"Yes, I think those are-"

"Are they on his head!?"

"Yes."

"Does Stewie have hair on his hands and feet?"

"Yes."

"How much?"

"Like, what's on your head, dad."

"Then, um..." I flipped through my father's notepad.

"Oh, Stewie, don't bother Grandma!"

"What's Stewie doing?"

"He's climbing on Grandma, Dad."

"Grandma," I said to my mother. "*Mom*. Do you feel anything?"

She looked frightened, but she spoke. "No. Nothing."

"Then... Stewie..." I flipped to the correct pages just to confirm it. "Stewie is an apparition, a pixie, or an imp." I rushed to the basement. "Mother, stay put. Abby, follow me. I need your help."

"Okay."
