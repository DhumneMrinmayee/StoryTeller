I didn't know why my door went nowhere, but the only thing I thought to do about it was keep gaming. So I shrugged and booted up FTL Multiverse and began an Imperial C run. A moment after I started, there was a knock on my door, and a song-like voice asked, "Hello? Is anyone there?" I sighed and got up to answer. 
On the other side was a vaguely humanoid cluster of orange crystals.
"Can I help you?"I asked somewhat tenuously. The crystal's quasi-face lowered to regard me. "Hello, child. I'm Captain Chriz of the FSC Amber. Did you create this door?" On impulse, I glanced at my screen. It appeared that a door had materialized in the Shields room, and a Crystal marked by the crew list as Chriz was facing it. "Uh, hold on." I reached over and closed the game. Chriz vanished.
Okay, I thought. If this door goes to whatever game I have open, and this is a permanent thing, then I need to find a game that l can survive in or at least make supply runs to. I considered my options. Dawn of War and Total War: Warhammer were instantly off the table. Subnautica: Below Zero had too great a risk of freezing to death, and the original a severe risk of Khaaraa or leviathan attack. Satisfactory had no edibles of significance, and FTL would get me diced by Mantis boarders or blown to bits by an MFK Ace. That left Minecraft, KOTOR, Meeple Station, and Tech Support: Error Unknown. Minecraft had zombies, creepers, and easily angered moderators. Meeple Station had pirates and an incomprehensible language. As compelling as KOTOR was, it could easily drop me off on Taris, and we all know how that ended. That left Tech Support: Error Unknown. The protagonist has a semi-stable job and presumably worked like a second Earth.
I knew what I had to do. I booted up Subnautica, because come on, who wouldn't see the wonders of 4546b firsthand given the chance?
As the door opened, I heard engines roar....
