**Astrenn needed the Shiny.** Even though her feathers were singed, even when the Angry Thing swiped at her with its claws, Astrenn needed the Shiny. And so the crow would get the Shiny. It didn't matter how long it took, it didn't matter how distracting the village was (ooh! Is that tinsel? She loves tinsel. No. No, focus. Astrenn needed the Shiny.) The Angry Thing was dumb, and even though it was strong and magical, the crow was clever-clever, fast-fast. The crow would win eventually.

The first thing to do was to get to a friendly nest. Right now, they were near the nest of the Large Baker—who used the Angry Things for cook-fires and shooed away the crows from the Delicious Breads. If the Large Baker came out on the street to investigate, Astrenn would never get the Shiny. So the crow flew to a nearby bin of Smelly Rotten Mush and tipped it over with a wingflap.

The crow knew this much about the Angry Things: they had a powerful sense of smell. And so as soon as the Smelly Rotten Mush poured out onto the street (to the dismay of the Large Baker), the Angry Thing awkwardly flapped away, the Shiny in its claws. The crow grabbed a small pebble (and a tinsel, for later), and shot into the sky, her feather-silent wings swift where the clunky, impossible weight of the Angry Thing farted along on inelegant wind magic.

"Caw," said the crow, and released the stone.

The Angry Thing must have been stupid, because it didn't even try to dodge the stone that *thunked* on its head. Unfortunately, the Angry Thing was a big ball of scales (shiny? No, not Shiny. Focus. Astrenn needed the Shiny) and probably wasn't even hurt by the rock. Which was no fair. Even the hard-hard-*hard* clams from the market got split open by a high-heavy-dropped rock. But at the very least, the Angry Thing dropped the Shiny, letting it twinkle to the ground like a wish upon a star.

Astrenn would get the Shiny. Astrenn *had* to get the Shiny.

The crow dove down, folding her wings tight and close to her body like she'd seen the swooping-fast-kill-above birds do, and snatched the Shiny out of the air. The Angry Thing dove after her, but it had fallen into her trap.

For these fields of amber grain were the nests of the Old Farmer, and they appreciated the crows for their ability to hunt-find-eat mice more than the Angry Things that set their barns and crops on fire.

The Angry Thing dove after the crow, heat lighting up in its maw as the crow settled on the ground, and the crow knew the Angry Thing thought it had victory in its stupid little claws.

But then, like a thunderbolt, a broom head slapped the Angry Thing out of the sky as the Old Farmer scolded it.

"Back, you silly little dragon! I won't have you burning the barn down today!" The Old Farmer had skin like wrinkle-walnuts, and he was unamused by the Angry Thing's presence in his nest. Another two broom slaps swept the defeated Angry Thing away, and the Old Farmer gave the crow a piercing look.

"Say... you're my daughter's friend, aren't you?" The Old Farmer chuckled to himself. "You clever little thing. Well, go on. She's waiting for you where we buried... oh, why am I bothering? You can't understand me; you're just a crow. Astrenn! Your crow's here to visit!"

The crow flapped towards the barn, where Astrenn was waiting. The little girl who'd once taken the crow in, feeding her, and keeping her warm when the nights grew cold. Astrenn had saved the crow's life when she was a hatchling, and the crow would do anything for Astrenn in return.

Astrenn needed the Shiny. And finally, the crow had delivered.

Astrenn looked up from the small lump of freshly-turned earth, the small, carved rock that stood where a mother should have been. Her cheeks glistened with sparkling droplets of water, but for once, the crow only wanted to wipe these shinies away.

"There you are, you silly lump of feathers." Astrenn sniffled and held out her arm; the crow hopped on and nuzzled her cheek. "What've you got for me today?"

The crow said, "Caw," and relinquished her treasures. A single gold coin for Astrenn, and a bit of tinsel for herself.

Astrenn giggled. "You crazy crow—where'd you get this? Mother would have fed you plump for days. Come on—we can still send her off, if we hurry."

Astrenn pocketed the Shiny and hurried into the market, exchanging the Shiny for some smaller sparkles and a bouquet of fresh flowers.

Then Astrenn and the crow returned to her mother's grave, placing the flowers in the center. After a moment of thought, the crow delicately balanced her tinsel on top, and Astrenn closed her eyes that shone like stars.

"She would have loved you, you pretty little girl."

"Caw," said the crow, perhaps agreeing, perhaps simply being there for her friend.

And Astrenn and the crow knelt there in mourning, until the sun bled red and the greatest shinies of all twinkled in the night sky above.
