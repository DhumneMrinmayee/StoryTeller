I thought moving to the city would get me peace, but it ended up even worse than it was. Sure, there are fewer talkers, but city dwellers are apparently all assholes. I was walking down the street one day when a crow walked up. He was asking for food. Yeah, that's normal, but I didn't have any. So, I told him. He started calling me things I... won't repeat. And the trees are all so contained, it's painful to watch. I think it's time to invest in a pair of headphones.
