**AITA for taking my anger out on charges for not being invited to the christening of my fairy-goddaughter?**

I [365f] went to the christening of my goddaughter[2 months old] only to find I wasn't invited.  
The parents didn't want me there because I wear black(it suits me and makes my features pop) and cackle when I laugh(not something I can control).  
Then they said they regretted me being declared their child's fairy godmother and went so far as to invite another fairy to act as a stand in.  
I lost my temper and used my magic to make a prophetic vision to get back at the parents; on her 15th birthday the child will prick their finger on a spindle and die of the resulting infection.  
Now they're accusing me of killing their kid in the future and threatening to never let me be a fairy godmother for any other child in the kingdom in future unless I magically fix it so their kid doesn't die, even going so far as to demand I also match their kid up with a handsome prince at the same time.  
I refused since magic shouldn't be used like that to change destinies and talking about marrying off a 15 year old to a 27 year old is creepy, but the other fairy used their magic to make it happen anyway so I fear my anger resulted in some very bad outcomes.

So AITA?
