The response to the press release was mixed to say the least. “Lord Savage speaks out against Starman hate”, who would have thought it. We’ve been fighting for years, I plan some devilish and stylish scheme and he would stop me in an equally over the top fashion; He is my worst enemy, my greatest adversary and I never thought for one second that he wasn’t enjoying it. But then the video was released.

‘I’ve been protecting the world against threats both terrestrial and extraterrestrial for almost as long as I can remember, it has been my pleasure but I have to admit that it’s has been taking a toll on me.’ Unbelievable words coming from the perfectly groomed adonis that could shrug off a missile telling us we he wasn’t invulnerable. I sunk in my throne when it was released, I watched as this man who I never doubted his enjoyment in his job describe the stress he feels, the family and friends he lost. For the first time since I started my empire building career I felt shame as he named me as one of the reasons he needed to take a break.

The public and media reacted violently, the idea that Starman was weak, or as some lesser outlets called him a “beta male”, chastising him for stepping down from his duties for a short time. The absolute radio silence from the Federation of Guardians, those who are meant to be his closest allies, made me sick; The great and honourable heroes stood there and did nothing as the worlds greatest son was lambasted by an unappreciative public, leaving his rouges gallery  to have to pick up the pieces.
