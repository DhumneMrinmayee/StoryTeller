You who holds dear what I come to seek. Know my fair and well so that I may meet ; The joy in my heart's who is so meek. To relish with the freshly packed sweet. I may hear of you what you come to show. A pleasure of what you and I already know. For each night that I came to your doorstep you've shown yourself a lil bit of my glow. This is no thievery for the trade that we have is nothing but good flow : You share sweets and pies, and I bless you to never meet exotic lies. For each of your sweet I share with you a bit of fullfiled soul. Something for the heart, the mule. For the fools, you will only care to their good measures. And for the brave you will fill their heart away from leisure. Such a deal I come to make, and each time, may you hear my steps.
