M'Darkel the Wizard had smashed the Blessed warriors with fireballs and repeated his brag; "The prophecy had stated that no human may slay me, these Words are from the Prophet Hemour, just before I slayed him" 

Tannek, unblessed, hadn't been caught in the rain of fireball. He glanced down at his blade, sleathed it, and ran toward the hill where the stump of Hemour's tree still stood. The only rise on the plain, lightning had struck the tree repeatedly until it was just a stump. The Wizard marched after him, determined to wipe out all of the warriors. 

Jabback, seeing his master running toward him, felt the rain hitting his bare skin. The storm was coming. The wind was picking up speed, thunder came from the distance. Could Tannek out run the Wizard's fireballs until the rain stopped the Wizard's fire? Jabback prepared the weapons for his master, the crossbows were tightly wound and the quarrels were loaded. 

The rain was pouring down, but M'Darkel wasn't worried. He could handle a unblessed warrior in his sleep, even without fireballs. Tannek glanced over his shoulder, and then looked skyward, the rain was falling fiercely and the thunder was closer. He slowed down and the wizard gained on him. Tannek ran across the crest of the hill, grabbed a crossbow and waited. 

M'Darkel crested the hill and was surprised to see Tannek. The quarrel pierced his chest.  He started laughing at the attempt. Then he saw Tannek raise the second crossbow t the sky. The quarrel soared into the storm, a thin wire trailer the quarrel. M'Darkel realized that the quarrel in his chest also had a wire attached. The lightning bolt found the rising quarrel, and the electricity followed the wire to the wizard. The explosion knocked Tannek back, but he remained standing, watching the wizard burn.
