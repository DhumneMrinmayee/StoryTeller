Gerry looked aghast. “*Me*? Immortal?”

Orlock nodded. At his age, hiding his chiropteran Features was getting harder and harder. It took effort, to stay in a human guise. “Yes. I believe I said that. Immortal....with an asterisk. You’d be vulnerable to sunlight and fire would twice as dangerous to you as it is to a human. Forced into daysleep every sunrise. Dependent on human blood for continued existence.”

Gerry nodded. “That....sounds more like a burden, than a blessing.”

Orlock waved his hand dismissively. “Eh, it’s not so bad. You get powers to go with it.”

“Powers?” Gerry asked.

“Yes,” Orlock responded, “Powers. From ESP to assuming the shape of a wolf. Unless killed by sun or fire, you’ll heal from *any* injury. You’ll grow physically stronger, and, given time, the Batwithin shall manifest—-and you shall *fly*.”

Gerry sputtered, “But, but, I like to go to the beach! My grandchildren have invited me, this year!”

Orlock sighed in contempt. “They’ll Be Dead before you know it, and, no, I am NOT threatening them....simply stating a fact. Years will whoosh by, and before you know it’s the 3rd Millennium and man is exploring the stars.”

“But why offer *me* this?”

Orlock smiled, fangs showing. “Your coffins are godsends, Gerry. I’ve never slept in better. It’s...*comfortable*, so to speak. I’d rather than talent not die with you.”

Gerry’s eyes widened. “But I’ll be one of the Damned?”

“Oh, please,” Orlock spat. “*Everyone* is damned, according to the New Testament! *Everyone*? Original sin, and all that nonsense. Why fear Hell, Gerry when you might never die a true death?”

Gerry blinked, and swallowed hard. “Can...can I think about it?”

“Very well, but don’t take too long.”

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Hello, a lunatic came in here and threatened to kill me!”

“We’ll send an officer over immediately.”
