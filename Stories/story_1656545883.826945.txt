"Polite?" I ask, "Some may call it creepy."

"How so?"

"You ever shut the bathroom door and... Well I don't want to say it in front of a lady but I think you know what I'm getting at."

"I...."

I can see it on her face as it starts to sink in. This dame has been putting on poopoo/peepee shows for years. Judging by that look, she ain't happy. Then again, when is a broad ever happy? I mean that's why I'm even in the office so early. I slept here. Throw me out, will ya? She knew what marrying a private dick would involve. Following targets, stakeouts, interviews.... She wasn't complaining when I bought her that mink stole. ahhh....I know the money hasn't been coming in lately but that's exactly why I was out. Working. She's my gal though and besides, who else is gonna love this old, cold fish? I'll pick her up some meatballs from Luigi's tonight. That always.....

"Excuse me?"

.....puts her in a better.....

"***EXCUSE ME?***"

"BAH!!  What!......Wha!.. uuhhh...oh...oh, sorry....sorry there. You were saying?"

"Ok! Is this something you can handle because this needs to......"

Something I can handle? If this lady only knew. I was in the Great War, the big one. Had no fear. Fear will getcha killed or worse, captured. .... and we were men back then. We knew those Krauts were gonna get most of us but did we run? Yeah, we ran.... Right at 'em. Johnny was the first to go and the first death I ever saw. Right in the head. He was dumb but I still felt bad. Then Charlie... Then Choppy. ***BAM!!         BAM!!*** Right in the chests. But I didn't turn around, not me. Back then I wasn't afraid of nothin'. I just didn't know any better. I was a fathead. A yuck. As I moved closer, it.......

***HELLOOOO??!***

"AH!....ahhh....I.... who....oh. Sorry doll, I was just thinking about...the.....uh.....your case."

"And? What are you going to do?"

Was this dope crazy? Door ghosts?......In Pittsburgh?........In July? Ha! Not since Wilson was destroying this great nation...or maybe it was Taft. Besides, I saw her open the door herself. Maybe she is crazy. Then again, somedays I think all broads are crazy. Not Margaret though, the one that got away. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, and I'm loyal too! But Margaret never did leave my thoughts. We were just kids, 9th grade...or was it 10th? Ah, what does it matter? We were young and dumb...... and in love. I remember exactly what she was wearing the first time I laid eyes on her. It was.......

***HEY!! HEYYYYY! HELLOOOO??***

*knock knock knock*

***ARE YOU IN THERE??!***


"AH!!.. WHAT THE?!!!...NO!!... please.... No hitting...no more...I.... where?..."


Suddenly a voice bellows from the other room.

"EMMA!... Stop messing with grandpa, please! Do you need something to do because I'll..."

"No mommmm....."

She looks at me with that evil grin. 

"Play with you later.....grandpa."

She shuts the light off on me and I hear her laughs fade down the hallway. Ghosts? No. I've got real evil to deal with. Just like that time in Detroit. It was 1942, maybe 3. Bruno and I had just....
