I'm a drug addict. And soon, I will be 50. That much is the truth, as for the rest of my tale, you be the judge. 

When I was raised, my parents didn't love. They just beat. I was fed, clothed, and sent to school, but the minute I complained about home, I got worse punishments. I would love to forget my youth. 

In young adulthood, I turned to alcohol and drugs. Anything, everything, to distract, and numb the pain. I started to have panic attacks, and when I wasn't using, I worked taking care of the elderly. Watching those I cared for die, was another reason to drink. I would love to forget that.

Maybe about the baby I had to give up for adoption. The ;drug use, the horrors of the mind, the years of dereliction, pain and slow suicide that I couldn't quite finish. 

Then there were the early years of sobriety, learning that I couldn't trust those who claimed to be trustworthy. Then there was the first marriage, where I was his favorite punching bag. I'd love to forgive all of that. 

How my own mother never stood up for me, how my father betrayed me, how my stepmother destroyed me... I'd dearly love to forget it all.

What crime? Please, what crime do I need to commit to wipe all of it? Please, Mr Lawyer, advise me, what do I need to do to wipe it, all of it, and start over?
