*Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*

Absolutely not. There is going to be food in there, but there are also zombies, giant mutant insects, and Things from Outside Reality - that last category could probably follow my room even after I turn the game off. Just, no.

*Ancient Domains of Mystery*

Food, again, exists. But there are all sorts of fantasy creatures out for my blood - I do *not* believe I could handle a dozen jackals. Plus, with the Chaos Gate open, I'll slowly get corrupted as I stay there, eventually turning into a mindless monster... no thank you.

*Tetris*

No food, plus I'll get crushed. No thank you.

*Starcraft: Brood Wars*

I'll be torn apart almost instantly. That or forcibly inducted into the Marines. This... might actually be the best option so far, which is really not good, but there's still one that I've been avoiding...

*Doki Doki Literature Club*

At least no-one in this one will try to kill me. And - well, there's cupcakes at least. And a protein bar appears at least once. Not to mention a vending machine... my diet won't be great, but at least food *exists*. Plus, no real danger of being killed. At least, not until the game ends and the universe collapses around me.

...

...but if I go into that one, then I won't be the only one to come back...
