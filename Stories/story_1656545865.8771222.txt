- Swaets?
- Sweets. The most delectable of confectionery, any on your person?
- Not for the twelfth time, ye ethereal wee cunt ye!
- Mr. Condor, I knew you were raised a wisecrack of greater lexicon, surely you would have had a greater mind for razing another character beyond base slurs
- You know my patience's spent with ye clawing at the door for no feckin' reason like a werewolf, if you're evolving into a pontificate I'm done with you.
- You know not to swear at a child.
- Hypocrite.
- Not so much guilt with it as you yourself harbour.

- ...

- What? Forgotten the time again this year? You saw the moon, I'm sure. October's first full moon as the custom has been so these past;--
- Step in out the rain so I can get a good look at ye. Its a freakshow that you're able to present yourself bone-dry when its bloody Baltic out there.
- Can't help it I'm afraid. What a wish I have, if only I could feel the water again. But of course, I'll oblige if only to satisfy custom.

- You and your fecking customs. Unfortunately no sweets again this year, miss.
- That's a shame. 
- Sure, don't break your neck on the way in.

- Its gross what hate you seem to reserve for me. You'd never have never shown this to mammy.
- Oh there's more where that came from, next time I'll have a rat's arse to offer you when aul Remi kicks the bucket in that cupboard of mine.
- Maybe a rat would do.
- You'd take a rat?
- It satisfies the parameters for a gift, I suppose.
- Fuck ye then. No rat.
- I was never here to antagonise you, sir. Could not one thing suffice? I could travel onwards no problem at all. I'm fearful I'll have to pester your soul in the afterlife.

-...No. 

- Can't let go of a regular visit, can you? How's the boys?
- No word of them. As usual. I hear one's a pilot now.
- That's nice. 
- Fucker can fly from Adelaide to Beijing in his prison ship and not a thought would cross his mind to land in Banbridge.
- That's the way of things. You are tied to them, you know. You needn't feel guilt about their absence.
- Aye I know. Its like I feel this pang to call for them but they don't feel the same to call me.
- A decade of being hung up on your wife would do that. Not many would want to help you bridge a gap over a hole you dug.
- Shut up.

- So same as last year then? You deny me exit, you damn yourself, life goes on until you choke in your sleep?
- That's the way of it.

-...

-...

- I never sought to hurt you, sir.
- You never did. You were coy like that, cunt. 
- This memory of us as children, it does you no good.
- Its all I have. 
- No. You have far more than this. You have videos, photos. Memories. Not just a horrible musing over our first chance upon eachother.
- I ought to delete them.

-...

-...

- One year though, you can meet me halfway. I'll meet you there. Talk to me as we were as children, and we can make it work. Just please stop trying to own me like a pet for your insatiable ego, it serves no good purpose.
- You're long gone from me, miss. 
- No, I'm not. I'm out there, probably.
- I saw your grave, miss. How do you expect me to reconcile with a dead woman?
- You can make peace with *me* though, can't you? The girl you knew from your childhood, who thought you'd be a chancer for a good bit of craic. I am dead, but I still live within you.
- You're gone, no physicality or beauty just an eerie oddity desperate for recompense.
- All it would take is a rat, sir. Liberty can be paid for with such a small price.
- And what, just forget? Piss it away, why don't I! Brilliant, it would be like we never lived at all. Thirty years of joy plunged into the deep and drowned!
- That joy will follow you to your own grave, sir. You know the truth of it.

-...

-...

- I never asked for your fecking company.
- Every year you refuse me the owed price is just another invitation. Hypocrite.
- I miss you, by God I fecking do. And I miss myself too, what youth I had.
- Oh, get over yourself, sentimental coot. I'll be back next year for you, should you still be standing.
- Then visit the boys, would you? They'd love to see you, if only once.
- Sir, I visited them once and no more. Only I was older with them. Funny that, their memory misaligns with yours. And so readily they were able to trade with me, unlike you who spites your own spirit.
- They never knew you as you were before. They wouldn't make sense of a child, they only knew their mother.
- Oh but they did make sense of me. Only you remain. I'll be back. Eventually.

-...

-...

- Sarah?
- Yes?
- Take the rat with ye.
