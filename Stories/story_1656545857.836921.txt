What should have been a single turn-in cat fetching quest for noobs turned into a 10 quest long chain involving trying to locate the cat amongst several randomized spawners, collecting four mice tails from giant rats that for some reason, only 1 in 100 have tails, fishing up an annoyingly rare fish ten times to make a special kind of bait, finding cloth by killing random mobs that have nothing else to do with your quest until they drop enough to turn in, a quest where you play an annoying mini-game to 'cook' the fish bait, wrap it in the cloth (of which you clearly only use one piece of cloth despite collecting 20) and wrapping it up with 1 of the giant rat tails, out of 4. There is only one bait.  Then the farmer tests it on a different cat and it needs something more potent, so you go out to get different ingredients to see what works best. You spend three separate quests instead of just one quest to collect all of them to get catnip, some smelly cheese, and literal garbage.   
You then stake out a specific location for the cat with your bait. 

Cutely, the cat falls asleep with a full tummy and you get to bring the sleepy kitty home, and surprisingly, you unlock a companion pet of this cat, so you basically stole the farmer's cat in the end even though it was the farmer that knew how to lure the cat in, he was just too old to do it alone.   


That cat, and the 12 silver that you got for the final reward almost made it worth it. Almost. But it didn't.
