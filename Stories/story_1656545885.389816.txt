AITA for loving fish too much?

I (8- girl) love fish...okay?! That's not JUST a big deal...it's a big, BIG, BIG DEAL!!! I love fish of all kinds! There are goldfishies, angelfishies, tigerfishies, and my favorite of them aaalll --tum tum tum-- PIRANHAS!!! *chomp chomp chomp*

If it weren't for my big braces, I can chomp just like 'em! My uncle, Dr. Sherman LOVES giving me fishies! He lives near the ocean, you see. But he ALWAYS gives me weak fishies! *hmph!* Like Chuckles, my goldfish! HE. STOPPED. MOVING! I thought he was asleep and I tried to shake him to wake him up but he never woke up. Mum said to go ask my uncle for another one and I saw a reeeeaallllyyy cute clownfish!

I wanted to get that clownfish but when I visited my uncle, he said it was already sleeping again. Then suddenly a huuuge bird came in the window and started flapping around! I screamed for my life! Even though my uncle got the bird out the window, his fishies went mad! One big striped fish hopped on me and he attacked my hair! He also attacked my clownfish and flushed him down the sink! Maybe he was jealous of the small fishie. I tried calling for the small fishie down the drain but the sink broke and water hit my face!

I didn't get my fish that day. *sob* AITA for loving fish too much?

Also, if you wanna give me fishies, drop them at my uncle's office. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney!
