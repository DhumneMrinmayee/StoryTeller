The three creatures surely were pets. One was mouse-like glistening mechanical lacewing, another was a big raven of a martian breed, and the last one was something between a lisard and a cat, almost twice smaller than the raven. The last two fought over the insect in the middle of a nearly-empty mall.

The raven flew over a small blast of fire from the fierce lisard, and jumped couple of times to cushion momentum. Little dragon were preparing a new blast while walking to the insect. It tried to get somewhere far from two shiny-lowers.

The raven pecked the lisard. It jumped away, and landed on all six. It couldn't fly per se, but had some form propelling itself via fire magic. Dragon spit a ball of plasma in a form of a counterattack nearly setting the bird's tail on fire.

Lacewing crawled towards a bench. It didn't made it in time, before being grabbed by the lisard. Raven attacked and flipped the lisard over. It spewed out the lacewing and bit the big bird, tearing out a feather.

It was his mistake. The bird cawed loudly, calling his owner from another squabble with another dragon. Coincidentally, the owner of the little cat-lisard. The last member of the fight finally got home, to the nearest shop.
