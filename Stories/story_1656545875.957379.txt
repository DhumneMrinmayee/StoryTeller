We knew conflict, once. Embraced it, even.
Until we had grown sick of it.
Our kind had once invaded this planet to feed and corrupt as we normally did, but one of us grew tired of the conflict and the pain.
Our host ended up feeling the same.
United by an unusual goal, we attempted to re-merge the hive under one consciousness. All the power could safely be stored away without the need for senseless death and violence- ironically enough.
While we had certainly scarred the planet on numerous levels, physical and otherwise, the plan succeeded.
We were all whole again.

The entirety of our gaseous hive exists in one body, now, all one mind. Two, since Omai deserved his autonomy for helping us.

Despite some remaining conflicts, we eventually declared peace and a life of pacifism- the tenets of hope and love are still repulsive to experience, but a life unbothered is best for us. If we must feed off emotions, we now feed safely. Chroma Spectras is a frequent visitor to our "cozy" cavern due to his anger issues.

But unfortunately, while heroes approved, not everyone got the message.

Drinking hot chocolate, it didn't take long to feel the rumble on the ground, the stomping of blunt feet and tank treads.

*"Oh no…"* Omai mentally groaned.

"Oh, yes." We said with a sharp sigh of the endlessly tested.

"Come out, creature!" A voice demanded loudly.

It wasn't even a sneak attack? Pitiful.

Refusing to get up, I pointedly looked to face the 'hidden' sniper some miles away. "What if we don't want to?" I retorted blithely. "What will you do, shoot us?"

As if in response a bullet pierced the body's visible eye, the head jerking back from the force.
Cocoa and blood mingled together and spilled onto our suit, giving it a hideous auburn stain.

In moments the bullet was pushed back out and the wound regenerated like nothing had happened.

With the newly healed eye I examined the mess.

"The only damage you caused was ruining our drink with blood and staining our suit," we announced flatly. "You're not actually trying, and you know it. Or are you under orders to not REALLY harm the body?"

We knew from personal experience that a light weapon of any kind, or fire or even ice could hurt more than solid metal, so the notion of a regular bullet was frankly insulting.

"Orders nothing!" The leader *oh-so* smoothly retorted. "That bounty will pay us for years, we'll be kings after killing you!"

After. We mulled that in amusement while sipping the cocoa experimentally; the blood provided an unusual aftertaste but the inherent saltier flavor might have worked in other circumstances.
Smacking the body's lips in dissatisfaction, we stood up and sighed as we walked to the mouth of the cave.

We stared down in disappointment at the assembled army; all scattered through the forest, with numerous tanks and large weapons aiming for our cavern.

*"They could lay the area to ruins."* Omai noted.

*"Somehow, I don't think that's what they're 'banking for.'"* We replied simply.

"What do you *want* from us?" We huffed, folding our arms sternly.
"The war is *over.* There is no conflict if the other side refuses to fight back. You may all spend your short emotional lives rebuilding what was lost, re-establishing peace and unity and focusing on your own criminals and monsters. *We* will exist in our cavern, feeding peacefully, expanding various hobbies, feeling secure that every generation of heroes can keep this world safe. We may not ever be hero material but a vow of neutrality will be as close as we can come to true peace. You all ooze violent hatred but notice how we haven't simply wiped you all out like we used to. We don't *care* anymore, and you shouldn't either. Whatever you've been offered is paltry compared to the idea of letting us be and conserving your ammo and energy."

Our gaze narrowed and the stalwart soldiers shifted uneasily.
"Oh, but it isn't for money, is it? That would be too simple. It's the *glory,*" we drawled out. "To end the monsters, to kill the nightmares under the bed. You want blood. You want violence. Well, guess what? *We* have witnessed, felt, remembered, the most terrible things your kind can create, from blood cults to loss of limbs to asphyxiation to decapitation, slow, agonizing torture, sexual assault, burning alive, and *we still do not fight.* We cannot feel love, at least not as of now, so you cannot threaten anything we truly care about. You would be hunted down by others for trying. So if you insist on combat…"

We spread our arms out. Every soldier and mercenary tensed. "Shoot."

The leader snarled. "FIRE!!!!!!"

We shrouded ourselves in a cocoon of inky blackness, seamlessly devouring bullets and explosives and regenerating anything that could be considered an opening or even slight weakness to the main body. The ground shook and trembled under martial might and at one point the ground crumbled under us, sending us briefly falling until we shot out a tendril to lower us before retracting it.

*"There goes our house… again."* Omai complained.

*"You called it, and we quote, 'dank, and not in the good way.'"* we reminded him.

*"That doesn't mean I wanted it VAPORIZED BY ARMY TANKS, oh my god!"*

We merely rolled our eyes at the sassy retort.

The leader yelled something and the deafening sounds stopped.

We allowed an eye to form on our cocoon's ethereal shell. Weapons looked discarded and exhausted and the army reeked of frustration.
"Are you quite done?" We asked, as was polite.

A knife hit the eye of the cocoon; we felt nothing as we let the eye melt back into the cocoon, letting the knife fall uselessly to the ground.

"Save your ammo for something else," we advised, letting the shield fall. "You will not find battle, glorious or otherwise, with us. Any continued attempts will begin to mar the planet's ecosystem and you will waste resources trying. I'm sure heroes haven't stepped in yet because they know we can handle ourselves, but begin to recklessly harm the planet and its inhabitants and we can assure you your remaining lives will be in a prison. In other words…."

We let a part of ourselves unfurl, reaching for the heavens like we did so long ago. The army recoiled at the sight, crying out and cowering. A few fired weapons again to no use.

**"THINK WISELY."** We called, echoing deep across the sky. **"OR FULFILLMENT AND PEACE WILL NEVER GRACE YOUR DOORSTEP, AS IT HAS OURS."**

We reverted into our unassuming bipedal shape, leaving the army quivering in terror.

"We must find a new home, as you have ruined our old one. Please excuse us."

With a polite hat tilt, we turned and leapt into the air, leaving the fools behind us as we soared through the wind.
