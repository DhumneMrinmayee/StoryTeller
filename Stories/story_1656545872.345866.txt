Decades of work.

Idari kept telling herself that it would all be worth it soon. The Sorcerer King would step forth from his Forgotten City, and bestow upon his loyal attendants limitless power. With it, Idari and the other Kingseekers would help the Lost One destroy this imperfect world and build a new one in His glorious image.

With any luck, He would also silence the screams that haunted Idari’s dreams.

Still, Idari had to acknowledge the strange silver light filling the ritual space, even as she told the others to focus. It was… serene. Nothing like the imposing will of their god. Worse were the blurs of sky-blue dancing through the chamber, gently lifting cloaks, hoods, tools, and books with something resembling curiosity.

Surely He could hear their voices? Why would He need to investigate his summoning ritual?

Decades of work. Years of doublechecking and cross referencing.

Idari couldn’t have made a mistake.

As the ritual reached its conclusion, she nearly convinced herself.

Then the portal stabilized and the Sorcerer King walked through.

It couldn’t be anyone else. The raw power pouring off the young man - who looked twenty at most - would have been palpable to even the most inert farmer. Not that there were many of those left.

To a scholar of the arcane like Idari, the boy was nearly blinding.

No one spoke as Finsteris, Sorcerer King and Keeper of Secrets glanced over the chamber. A slight smile graced his sharp features. As he turned to face Idari, the shoulder length silver curls seemed to glitter with starlight.

*“This is… different.”*

It would be. The Sorcerer King hadn’t been walked the world since his ascent and -

*“ It has been a while though. So, which terror of the night do you need banished? I would bet the Choir, but I suppose it could be something new.”*

“My Lord - We…” Idari nearly swore in frustration. She couldn’t show weakness or hesitation in front of their…

*“Stars above, be not afraid! I’m no demon pretender, waiting for the opportunity to wear your skins. Your ritual was fine. Textbook. You’ve summoned the Sorcerer King himself, at what appears to have been a great cost. How can I help?”*

… Help?

“My Lord, we have indeed worked long and hard in your name. We have put your enemies to the sword and raised your symbols over a dozen, dozen cities. Now, with your blessing, we will remake the world in your divine image.”

*“Remake… hold on. Who - exactly - were you trying to summon?”*

Idari’s mind raced. Banishing spell, keyed to also dismiss the portal? Whoever this entity was, it was not -

*“Finsteris? Oh. you poor things. I’d feel sorry for you, if you hadn’t just implied that you unabashedly killed a great number of innocents in ‘my’ name.*

The youthful laugh seemed to spur the cultists into action. All around the room, incantations started, arms waved, but the Kingseeker’s magic died before it left their fingers.

*“I am* ***not*** *Finsteris. He tried, and failed, to take my mantle.”*

The blue-and-silver light still danced around the chamber. Faster now, responding to the god’s growing fury.

*“You asked for the Sorcerer King. I am he. Acalea. First of my Name, Lord of Magic, and Keeper of the Veil Between.*

*You wanted cities unmade? Divine power parceled out to the faithful? A world cleansed of the unworthy?”*

*“So be it.“*
