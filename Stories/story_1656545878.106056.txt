It took some time to get used to, the concept of being trapped in what could be a game server.
I didn't have visible health bars while in my room or inventory management but I wasn't invincible; if you cut me I still bleed.

But as fun as racing games were, solving puzzles and rhythm games I still had to eat.
So I took a shower to feel good before strapping a backpack on, loaded up my survival game and cautiously opened my door; the last safe space I have in this void.

I stepped out onto a cobblestone path, looked up at the clouds and the sun behind them. I do miss the real sun, this one is so manufactured it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth every time I stepped out. Still, the food was amazing and easy to get.

I walked forward and opened my trusty chest, quickly equipping my enchanted armour and tools; learned pretty quickly that items despawn when in the safety of my room and the game exists. Lucky this was was easy to run, I did play it many years before my... "event".

Safety and weapons sorted I looked at the fields of melons, potato, wheat, carrots, I even picked up the taste for beetroot.

Thanks to redstone I flipped a switch and auto harvested (almost) everything using water, ran to collect and spent a few moments replanting it all. I'm so glad that everything here takes as little effort as the computer version, I would never have the energy to jump these cubes all day.

By now the sound of my cow farm was driving me nuts so culling the herd and feeding them wheat I then set off; if I wanted a snack I'll need cocoa beans and I haven't found any yet. Consumed by cookie cravings I nearly missed seeing the sun about to set, and at the edge of the forest I turned around as I decided that I can wait another day.
