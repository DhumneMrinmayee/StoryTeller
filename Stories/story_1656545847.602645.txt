"You're a vampire aren't you."   
  "And you're a hunter. How do you live with yourself knowing you posess such wild hypocrisy?"  
   "Me?! Your kind have killed so many  innocents: men, women and children even."  
    "You didn't even know those people. Your kind, hunters that hunt for the sake of it, killed my grandfather and my great uncle. Nearly my sister too."  
 Mumbles. "Wouldn't have been nearly if it were me hunting."    
"  What did you say?"  
    "So we hate each other. What now? One two three and we try to kill the other?"     
     "You know I really would, but the rent here would be unaffordable. I can barely afford it with the both of us."  
  "Yah and it's hard to get a roommate where someone died. People can sense it somehow. Not to mention the difficulties with the body these days."  
     "Urgh. I'd hate for the place to go to some posh newcomers who want to 'spice it up'. It's beautiful, it's old and perfect."   
  "Times were so much simplier.( I mean sure we were hunted more but...)"    
    Silence
  "Actually what was I even saying. I haven't killed a human in decades."  
  "Sigh. I don't seek out vampires to hunt anymore and the business hardly pays nowadays. But I can't really do much else."   
     "So, new idea. What if you pretend to vampire hunt, to earn us some money?"
