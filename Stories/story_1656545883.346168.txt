Jimmy had known about his powers for weeks. They had cost him a relationship; allowed him to pass his Bar exam perfectly; he even deliberately missed a few questions to seem more credible; and in the end, had allowed him to truly set his life in order. The ability to truthfully answer any question, even if he didn't know the answer? It made him wealthy overnight with five stock purchases and one lottery ticket. He decided, as he was acquiring his new house, his new car... that he was going to become a superhero. And, of course, with his new powers, he could solve every case, instantly!

&amp;#x200B;

The first one was easy enough. A woman crying on the street. Recently mugged, apparently. Half an hour later, the mugger was unconscious; a nice high-grade taser did the work; and he was handing the woman back her belongings. 

The real problems began with his second case. Who had killed the young man across the street? Robert Hiller. Where was evidence that could convict Robert Hiller? In the dumpster two blocks from Hiller's house, under a bag of cat food. When he approached the police; who already had a suspect in mind; at first, they thought he was insane. Here he was, some nutjob in what looked like a antique dime-store superhero costume of green and blue over a bullet-proof vest. After about an hour, though, one of them humored him; and followed along. When he found the gun, at first he thought Jimmy was the killer; but it took just a few seconds, and a few questions, to verify Jimmy's power was real, and worked. It did, granted, end with the Sergeant breaking off his marriage. Asking 'How many kids do I have?' and getting 'Two, but you're also raising two of your brother's sons as if they were your own' was not the answer that was expected, or wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

When Hiller was arrested a few hours later, his father; a US senator; made a few phone calls. And Jimmy kept using his powers. Asking questions about the Senator. The Senator's friends. The President. The local police were torn between horror and awe; they knew exactly where to dig to find the bodies, exactly who had been killed and why... and were looking at a long, miserable slog that would probably end with dozens of high-ranking politicians in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it didn't actually end up that way. While Jimmy was sitting in the local precinct, helping resolve a few cold cases, proud of what incredible good he was going to accomplish with his power, he saw... his own costumed form on TV. The police saw it at the same time as he; how he was a terrorist. A supervillain. The most wanted criminal in the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a moment, he thought the cops were about to arrest him. But they knew what was going on, and why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Six hours into his superhero career, and the president had declared him one of the most dangerous supervillains on earth; that he could somehow hypnotize people into believing whatever he said. That he was to be shot on sight, and absolutely not to speak with him before doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Five minutes later, he was driving a new car, his costume abandoned, and his superhero career officially over. Maybe he needed to approach this from a different angle. Maybe he really should become a supervillain; seemed a good way to make a difference.
