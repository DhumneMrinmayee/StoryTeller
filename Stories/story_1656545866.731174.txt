# Soulmage

**The nursery rhyme was nameless, as most such rhymes were.** It hovered on the edge of childhood memory and half-remembered dream, wavering as it sang through the glossy-sheened halls.

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... and now, what shall we play?*

I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and sat up, back aching from lying on the painted wooden bed. Where... where was I?

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... now summer's gone away.*

The room was dim and uncannily familiar, a bizarre mirror image of my rental room. I tried opening the door—it felt far too light to be made out of wood—and stepped into the creaking hallway.

"Hello?" I called.

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... I'll bring you back to me...*

Though the hallway had more doors than anyone could count, the song was only coming from behind one of them. Instinctively and unerringly, I stepped forwards, trying to open the door—but it was nothing more than cheap paint on a wall, a facade as thin as a wish.

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... and I will set you free...*

I knew that voice. I *needed* that voice. Hearing it on the other side of the wall was like a fishhook driven through my chest, inexorably tugging me forwards. I looked around for a way through, but even if I was the size of an ant, there wasn't the slightest crack in the smooth, oily wall.

But it was only a facade.

I took one step back, two, then hurled myself forwards, slamming through the painted door. It snapped instead of splintered, whatever material it was made of clearly not wood, revealing the... entity... on the other side.

The doll was the size of a human child, its too-wide eyes and cherubic blush contrasting with the distressingly fleshy lips and obscenely realistic teeth. Beneath its shoulders, even the attempts at seeming lifelike ended, a metallic, ticking skeleton of gears and springs whirring away, all powered by a humming, glowing box.

It sang with my mother's voice.

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... now, go to sleep, my child...*

*Tick... tock... goes... the clock... and let... your dreams... run wild...*

"Mom?" I whispered, throat tightening.

The doll's head swiveled towards me, and I screamed.

It stood with uncannily fluid speed and unhinged its jaw and *nope nope nope* I wasn't staying around to find out what happened next. I was already sprinting back down the hallway as its distorted singing chased me:

*Tick, tock, goes the clock, the song draws to an end.*

*Tick, tock, goes the clock, forever we'll be friends.*

It was catching up. Oh, rifts, it was catching up. The floor quavered beneath my feet as I ran—

Quavered beneath my feet.

This entire place was a facade. Painted doors, paper-thin walls...

...and a floor so thin it shook when I stepped on it.

Desperately, I turned to face the oncoming demon. Its lips—*my mother's lips*—twisted up into a grin as I stopped—

I stomped as hard as I could on the floor, and the demonic doll fell into an abyss of clockwork and gears.

Somewhere very, very far down, two massive gears ground up the demon with a spark.

I stood there on the teetering edge of the chasm, catching my breath.

And then a wisp of light rose from the void.

Even in death, it still mournfully sang—but now, the brassy, twisted tones of the demon's body had faded, leaving me with the voice of my mother as I knew her when I was still a child.

*Tick, tock, goes the clock, and though the time may fly...*

*Tick, tock, goes the clock, we're family, you and I.*

"Mom," I breathed, and it was as much prayer as joy.

The soul fragment twinkled in the air, uncertain.

Then I reached out and let it in.
