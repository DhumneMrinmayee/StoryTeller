Ashbjorn cursed his own luck as an axe the size of a modest doorway swung at where his head was only moments ago. Drake was already knocked out and lying in a puddle of his own blood and piss, his armor was sporting beautiful new holes in several places. His sword was doing a shockingly good impression of a snapped tree branch. That bitch Crimson had dipped the moment things got hairy.

&amp;nbsp;

"How much longer?!" Ashbjorn shouted at the only other party member still worth anything.

&amp;nbsp;

"Fifty percent!" Gareth replied from behind.

&amp;nbsp;

"Hurry the fuck up!" Ashbjorn risked a glance over his shoulder as the monster advanced. Gareth seemed to be performing a strange ritual which consisted of waving his arms back and forth like a progressing bar. He looked ridiculous. 'This is it. This is where I die,' Ashbjorn thought to himself.

&amp;nbsp;

"I need to define an installation directory, check for software compatibility, and–"

&amp;nbsp;

"Not now, Gareth! A little busy!" Ashbjorn rolled to his left, caught himself on a nearby tree, and sprung from it. The speed at which he changed direction surprised the monster, and Ashbjorn was able to get a strike in with his dagger. It was too shallow unfortunately. Curse this thing's thick hide. He never should've left The Pub.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*\*

&amp;nbsp;

The Pub wasn't the sort of place you brought your children. It was dirty, dingy, and most of all dangerous. It was the sort of uncouth spot you might find a bandit pretending to be a upstanding mercenary or an animal feed merchant gaslighting as a restaurant bartender. Unfortunately for Ashbjorn, it was also the place The Guild posted their job offers.

&amp;nbsp;

"An installation wizard," a cheery voice tried to explain. The man wore a navy blue cloak three sizes too big and speckled with obnoxious stars. He held a wooden staff with what looked like a giant paperclip on the end. His pack was overflowing with books and scrolls. Frankly, he looked absurd and completely unfit for a hunting job. Ashbjorn questioned whether the man was lying or if the guild ladies had simply lost their minds recommending someone like this.

&amp;nbsp;

Drake frowned, "Is that some sort of magic carpenter? Do you install appliances in homes?"

&amp;nbsp;

Crimson offered a more sensible explanation, albeit also a bit poor, "Perhaps... he magically installs traps...?"

&amp;nbsp;

"No no, I perform application package installation, verifying client certification and establishing server communication while providing end user license agreements."

&amp;nbsp;

"Did you catch any of that?" Even Crimson was stumped with this one.

&amp;nbsp;

Ashbjorn rubbed his chin. Some of those words sounded familiar, but be couldn't quite grasp their meaning.

&amp;nbsp;

Drake simply stopped thinking and asked, "Can you cast offensive magic?"

&amp;nbsp;

"Yes, in fact I provide backwards compatibility with unsynchronized client–"

&amp;nbsp;

"GOOD! That's all I needed to hear, now let's get going."

&amp;nbsp;

"But don't you want to know about–"

&amp;nbsp;

"NOPE." Drake indicated the conversation was over by picking up his shield and heading for the door. Crimson shrugged and followed him out.

&amp;nbsp;

"It's alright," Ashbjorn offered. "I can listen if you like, but I'm not sure how much I would understand."

&amp;nbsp;

"No... it's okay. No one ever pays attention to anything I have to say anyway." The wizard was clearly dejected and Ashbjorn felt a little bad for him.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*\*

&amp;nbsp;

Four goblins danced around a campfire in a clearing just ahead. Their figures created strange and eerie shapes in the dim moonlight as they circled a gruesome totem. Limbs jutted out of the burning effigy at obscene angles, heads lolled grotesquely, and mouths gurgled in their last moments of life. One of the bodies lay in a pool of its own blood and another was missing several limbs. A third had been impaled with a spear. Judging by their attire, Ashbjorn guessed they must be the missing caravan members they were instructed to rescue if possible. Guess that wasn't happening, poor fellows.

&amp;nbsp;

A fifth goblin with blue hair and a large wooden stick appeared at the edge of the clearing and began to shout something unintelligible while waving its hands. Ashbjorn strained to decipher the gibberish, but his ears weren't quite adapted to hearing the language. Crimson gestured at the two closest and Ashbjorn understood. He readied his crossbow and waited for her signal.

&amp;nbsp;

Two bolts flew from their spot with uncanny speed and accuracy, each striking their intended target in the skull. The remaining three goblins stopped to look at their fallen comrades with confusion, before noticing the quarrels sticking out from their domes. In a single breath, Drake and Crimson were already in their midst swinging and cutting with expert precision.

&amp;nbsp;

Ashbjorn loaded his next bolt, steadied his aim at the leader, and fired. Surprisingly, the goblin was staring right at him unfazed. Ashbjorn even noticed a smile on his grotesque features as the bolt drilled between his eyes. Without warning, the bonfire suddenly exploded and *something* gigantic and wreathed in flames stepped out into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;

"OHHHH FUCK!" Drake's signature emergency battle cry was unmistakable. 

&amp;nbsp;

A tree flew overhead, crashing behind Ashbjorn. He steadied himself on a nearby rock. What the hell was that? 

&amp;nbsp;

Crimson emerged from an unseen shadow beside him, "Bad news, that last goblin summoned something terrible. Good news, it's not my problem." And with that, she melded back into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;

"What the F– Get back here you cunt!" but it was no use, all traces of her presence had disappeared.

&amp;nbsp;

The monster's twin horns gleamed in the moonlight. The flames covering it were dissipating now, revealing a rippling mass of muscles underneath. It moved with impossible speed. There was no outrunning this creature, not for him anyway. Each swing of its furniture-sized axe split the air with a deafening boom. The very forest shuddered at its power. Drake was doing a commendable job keeping the minotaur at bay, but it would only be a matter of time. 

&amp;nbsp;

Gareth was imitating a roly-poly by his feet and Ashbjorn kicked him, "You're up. Do something about *that* or we'll all be dead."

&amp;nbsp;

"But-but- installing packages takes time, I have to check for system support and–"

&amp;nbsp;

"I can buy you a minute or two maybe, now get to it." Ashbjorn drew his dagger. Bolts wouldn't do anything to the minotaur's thick hide. Drake tumbled into a nearby tree and Ashbjorn regretted every decision in his life that led him here.

&amp;nbsp;

\*\*\*

&amp;nbsp;

"Eighty five percent!" Gareth was now on his belly simulating a crawling worm.

&amp;nbsp;

Ashbjorn really wanted to ask what the fuck he was doing, but avoiding death was currenting using all his resources. The minotaur's axe crashed into the ground by his side, splitting rock and earth. It was bleeding from several cuts Ashbjorn was lucky enough to get in, but they were barely papercuts in comparison to the gashing wounds he'd suffered in the same time frame.

&amp;nbsp;

"Ninety percent!" The installation wizard was full on sprinting in place as fast as he could and going nowhere. Nothing he did made any sense.

&amp;nbsp;

A moment's error brings tragedy to the battlefield. The minotaur swung with its other arm and caught Ashbjorn in the ribs. A stiff crack reverberated throughout his body. He couldn't breathe and the pain was unbearable, yet he struggled to stand again. He had to. Whatever Gareth was doing, it was their last hope and he needed to protect him.

&amp;nbsp;

"Ninety five percent!" Gareth's staff was carving a perfect circle through the air in an impressive display of agility. If only he could use that skill in combat.

&amp;nbsp;

Ashbjorn gripped the minotaur's ankles as it tried to approach the installation wizard, "You're not going anywhere."

&amp;nbsp;

The minotaur let out a guttural roar and kicked Ashbjorn. His body launched across the clearing like a rag doll without strings. Every bone in his body must've be broken now. Ashbjorn watched as light gathered into the paperclip on Gareth's staff. The minotaur plodded closer and closer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then to everyone's surprise, the installation wizard knelt down, fished out a huge scroll out from his pack, and began reading, "By agreeing to this End User License Agreement, you–"

&amp;nbsp;

"I FUCKEN AGREE, NOW GET ON WITH IT!" Ashbjorn's vision was starting to dim, it was taking all his processing power to stay conscious.

&amp;nbsp;

Gareth smiled.
