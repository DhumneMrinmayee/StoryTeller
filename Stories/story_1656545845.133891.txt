I look at the man and smile sarcastically. "Who said I was trying to kill you?" 

The king looks puzzled at first. He looks as if he's about to ask a question, or maybe several questions, but he's interrupted by an ominous rumble from deep inside of his own bowels. 

The kings eyes grow wide. "You're responsible for..." He's interrupted by an even louder grumble. The man starts off with a sad cautious shuffle down the great hall. 

An ambassador of my parents' home country approaches him. "Your Lordship I've been patient with you for this entire evening but we really must discuss the terms of our treaty at some point."

The king shoves him out of the way as he looses a wet sounding fart. The sad shuffle becomes a skipping jaunty jog as his imperial majesty begins to clutch his backside. He shouts back at the ambassador, "just take what you want and sign my name to it!"

The jog turns into a dead sprint, a thoroughly impressive feat for an obese, gout ridden man in his 60s. Several dignitaries are shoved out of the way in the process. A noble woman literally flies through the air briefly and lands in the middle of the dessert table. An elderly lord is shoved into a spitoon.

The king nearly reaches the end of the great hall when it finally happens. A loud collective gasp escapes the nobility in the room. The king has painted his marble floors brown. 

I'll almost certainly be executed for this, but it's nice to see that gluttonous tyrant humiliated for once.
