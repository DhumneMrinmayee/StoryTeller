“I will hear no excuses from you, little guy. Drake’s mom just called and wanted to make sure he was fast asleep by 10.”

“But please mom. We are on the final boss. Just give us 15 more minutes, please, please, please!” Adragon begged.

His mother let out a lengthy sigh.

“Fine. But you all better be fast asleep when I come back to check on you and don’t forget to collect after yourself.”

“Ok.” He reassured back, before shifting his focus back to his friend.

“Are you sure we will be able to finish this in 15 minutes?” Wyvernina asked hesitantly.

“Well I hope so or I am toast.”

“Anyways let us do this fast. Where were we …. Ah, so Lucy the receptionist and Jeffery the data entry clerk after a long day of trials and tribulations were fast approaching their boss’s room. They were ready to ambush their boss for a salary raise, but little did they know their boss was prepared.”

As you enter the room, you see him sitting in his leather chair, vigorously typing hollow emails about everyone being a big family at the company back to the dozens of leave notices he had received in the past day. ROLL for INITIATIVE!

“Wait, already?” Wyvernina was surprised. “Well uhmm … I rolled a 7.”

The boss gives a monotone remark about wasting company time on some futile quest for a raise when you should be at your desk taking phone calls. You get -2 on your next 3 rolls!

“Well, I tell him that my work hours are finished. I rolled a 16, so that makes it 14.”

“You successfully counter his remark as you show him your logbook. Your rolls are back to normal and your party gets +3 confidence for this fight.”

He says that you should start working overtime like everyone else.

“I tell him that I had worked overtime for a total of 12 hours, but I have yet to be compensated. I rolled a 10.” Drake interjects.

The boss implied that your words are just senseless accusations with no backing evidence. You received -2$/hr salary damage.

“I pull up Jeffery's work hours for the last 2 months and present it to him. I rolled an 18.”  Wyvernina interrupted.

You have successfully recovered Jeffery's salary by +4$/hr, as the boss bickers to himself, he readys a special attack that will flood your next turn with stacks of work papers that need to be signed by tomorrow evening, losing you one action point.

“I use my special skill ‘Friends in high places” to call human resources, allowing them to answer instantly rather than taking an extra turn.”

Drake smiled as he look down at his dice. “I rolled a 20!”

The boss tries to stop you by using ‘pitiful raise’, but your confidence is too high for it to affect you. The conditions have been met for the finisher ability ‘Saving face”. The boss receives a phone call telling him he will be relocated to a branch in Detroit, instantly depleting all his salary.

“Hell ya” both of them shouted as they gave each other a high four.

As you approach the boss who was weakishly panting on the floor, he gives out a slow chuckle.

“This office will no longer be tormented with your ego, boss or should I say ex-boss.” Wyvernina remarked.

“It is true you might have done me in. But as I said, your quest for a raise is futile.”

Suddenly, his computer screen starts flickering, then two videos start playing. It was of both of them using their phones to browse social media during company time.

“No, it can’t be. You can’t use this against us!” Jeffery exclaimed furiously.

His boss chuckled loudly and started coughing blood till slowly nothing was left of him.

“ARE YOU DRAGONLINGS STILL PLAYING.” They heard Adragon’s mother shouting from across the hall.

“Oh shoot!”
