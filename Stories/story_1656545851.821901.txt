"First of all, anyone who calls Mongoose weak can meet me in the pit. He's temporarily beaten me on occasion, so if he's so weak, I shouldn't be a challenge at all."

"Secondly, I don't see any of you doing anything a fraction as impressive. You still need Mongoose to save you from the 'terrifying villains'. Even the kind of pathetic excuses for villainy who have nothing but a gun that shoots cold and a silly outfit, let alone *me*."

"If depression makes him weaker, then what would he be *strong*? I relish the prospect; it's gotten entirely too easy lately, and I'm not going to improve any of my designs without a stronger opponent. It serves no one to hide their own flaws; how will they improve if they can't acknowledge them? I am, as ever, for strength over weakness, and a weakness hidden is still a weakness."

"Many people are afflicted with similar weaknesses, and would be better served eliminating those weaknesses. And while I, being as I am, solve my own problems, that is a luxury many do not have available. It is far better to solve such problems with assistance than to leave it unsolved. You have only one life to live - do not waste your potential by leaving yourself hamstrung by obstacles you could remove or overcome." 

"Unsurprisingly, I also firmly recommend acquiring more than one life to live. But I am by this point unsurprised that all the plebs are obnoxiously resistant to the idea of overcoming natural limits. For the sake of any with the will, but not the skill to do it themselves, I will remind the public of my list of open challenges. A solution for longevity that respects the recipient's ethical limits - within reason - is among the rewards I would grant to any successful challenger."
