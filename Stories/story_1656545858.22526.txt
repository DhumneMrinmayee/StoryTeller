990.

Its been decades. I'm ashamed and sorry that I've forgotten you and our promise.

991.

We've known each other since we were young. We've always hung out together, inseparable like twins. 

992.

I never really had anything I wanted to do, no dream nor ambition. I thought it would be fine to live and die in this small town.

993.

But you were different. You wanted to explore the world and the seven seas. The sparkle in your eyes when you spoke of your dreams, it was brighter than any diamond.

994.

You were dazzling, like the sun. I couldn't help but want to chase after that dream of yours with you and see it through.

995.

We made a promise with each other.

996.

That once we graduated and saved up enough money, we'll get the hell out of this small town and travel together.

997.

You and me would be free at last. And if  any one of us broke the promise we would both cross our hearts, hope to die and stick a thousand needles in our eyes.

998.

But fate took you away from me, just as we were about to make our dreams come true.

999.

After you left for the next world, I stayed behind in this town and grew old. Slowly 
forgetting both our promise and you.

1000.

I'll be joining you soon my friend. When we meet again, let's fulfill our promise.
