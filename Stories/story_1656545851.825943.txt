I appreciate this more than you know.

I had a college friend who felt my medication was a crutch that I shouldn't have to be dependent on for my entire life. He believed that since his own dad happened to have a miraculous recovery from his own mental health problems after having a spiritual journey out in the wilderness (they're Native American), then I could too if I tried hard enough as well.

I was dumbfounded by his ignorance that all mental health problems could be solved the same way, and offended by the implication that my suffering persisted because I haven't tried hard enough to overcome it. However, the guy had been so sincere about it all, it was clear he had the best of intentions.

Intentional or not, a lot of people tend to be toxic and/or unsupportive when they find out someone they know has mental health issues. The root of the behavior generally comes from willful or passive ignorance, which I try to look at as its own disease - it helps me to be a little more patient with others.
