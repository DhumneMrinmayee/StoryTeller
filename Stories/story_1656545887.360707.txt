A young man, Eric, walks into a darkened lecture hall, every seat filled with a shadowy figure. As Eric walks onto the elevated stage, he can feel every set of eyes bearing down on him. He takes a deep breath as he steps behind the podium.

"Let me ask you all one question," said Eric, "are you...scared of me?"  The crowd begins to murmur amongst themselves. "Nah, of course not, I'm just a guy, but you all are superheroes! The best of the best so I've been told. So why would you all be scared of little old ***ME***?" With a \**THOOM*\*, Eric's words echoed throughout the hall, giving the room a small shake.

Several of the shadowy figures stand up in shock, or they at least try to before being slowly forced back into their seats by some unknown force.

"Oh no, don't get up," said Eric, "I'm just getting started. My name is Eric Cross, I have been a superhero for about six years, and I've ***NEVER LOST***." Eric walks from behind the podium and sits on the edge of the stage. "You know why I've ***NEVER LOST?*** because I've never had to deal with ***MORONIC WANNABE HEROES WITH DELUSIONS OF GRANDURE!***"

At this point, most of the audience were drowning in their seats, the weight of gravity too strong to fight against.

"Let this be a reminder," said Eric, "stay out of my way and live to see another day." Eric gets up and walks off stage. Once out of sight the audience is freed from gravity. As they talk amongst themselves, Eric sits backstage, hand clutching his chest, in a total panic. "I can't believe that worked!"
