After a few experiments I determined that the door indeed opens to whatever videogame I launch. Kinda feels like a dream come true, right? Well, apparently escapist fantasy only works when you're a hero. Or when you can save and load. Living as a humble NPC... Kinda sucks.

Still, I sifted through my collection. The plains of Limgrave gave me chills, I didn't dare even step outside. This world was death incarnate. I stared a little at the vast expanses of the forbidden west, but as beautiful as they were, I won't make it to the nearest settlement. A shame, really. It would be nice to play a typical Isekai hero and return some lost knowledge to this world.

Then it got weird. Nefarious city met me with a storm of industrial noises and neon lights. As much as I hoped to borrow Ratchet's Dimensionator to get back to my world, this  city was also a no-go for an organic lifeform like me.

I didn't dare to boot up No Man's Sky. Vacuum of space or toxic atmosphere of a random planet would be even more deadly than unforgiving Elden Ring enemies. 

Which is why I was now walking the streets of perfectly normal NYC, except for that Avengers tower, of course. My phone was still working here, I found some free WiFi and checked the news. It seemed that Roxxon company was still around, which meant that 1) I'm very much in danger and 2) I can use spoilers from the game to fix that sad ending. All I need to do is find a friendly neighbor, which should be easy since he's using an app to help people! Yeah, this will definitely work out nicely. And after I help Miles save the city (and his best frenemy), I can just... Stay here? Marvel universe shouldn't be too bad, right? At least they don't have covid.

... 

Oh crap.
