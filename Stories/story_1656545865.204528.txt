We never actually expected it. We just wanted to go out with a bang. Yet we did it.

We killed a god.

Still it was a hollow victory. The numeber of being, blessed or cursed does not matter, we sold our souls to  was too big to even keep count.

So we killed them too. Turns out when you kill a being lending you something, you not only keep it, but you also take the rest for yourself.

When others realized what was happening, it was far too late. Even united they fell.

Because what are godslayers, if not gods themself.
