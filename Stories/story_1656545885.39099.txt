AITA for not letting my step daughter go to a party?

So, background, my (43F) daughters (16F, 17F) and step daughter (16F) were invited to a party. I tell my SD that she can go if she finishes all her chores in time. She manages to get them done, but then I realize she doesn't have an appropriate outfit to wear, so I have to backtrack and tell her she can't go. She starts crying and tells me that she always gets all the chores and all she wants to do is go to this party.
AITA?

Edit: She can't borrow a dress because she's way smaller than her stepsisters
