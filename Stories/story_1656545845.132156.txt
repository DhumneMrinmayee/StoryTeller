 I work for a fucking psychopath. 

    It started out well enough. Good pay, free meals, and a general sense of autonomy given my high position. There was a certain strangeness to the arrangement. However, my need for approval and adulation outweighs my moral code.

  Originally, the commission seemed easy enough.
"Create for me a draught that could fell one thousand men." 

   That's what the guy fucking told me. I said " Sure, no problem." I really wish I hadn't said that. Hell, I wish I'd never agreed to take the position.

  My employer was very excited to take me onboard and all too keen on paying me top dollar. Money was no object to him and he seemed almost pleased to pay such a ludicrous amount. I, of course, graciously accepted.

  Now, here I am. Sitting in my office waiting for the other foot to drop. A master of my craft put in to the corner for a time out.

  I know poison and ran countless tests on rodents, sheep, and... other mammalia. Like I said before, I'm not exactly the guy you hire if you're looking for a moral compass.

  I just hope the Count will give me another shot because this gig is once in a lifetime and I get the definite impression that this guy has lived several.
In a manner of speaking.

  I think I should have just gone with the garlic and silver shavings recipe.
