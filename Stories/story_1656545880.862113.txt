Time is a fickle thing it never stops, never pauses and is ever on the march forward, I can but bring those whose time has ended back but only for a few hours. It's enough to allow them to finalise there wills or advise me of who did what and to whom but they are the rarities now a days but I guess today is going to be one of those ones. I sighed, A call from the Ceres Police force. "Uh huh, tunnel off of Armstrong and Aldrin, sure give me 30 minutes to get my stuff together".

"It's not painful for the dead to rise again, but living those final moments over can be very hard" I said to the young man whose once lifeless corpse was pinned to a wall with rebar.

"So what happened?" I asked the man. "Well from what I remember I was walking down this tunnel corridor" he said he voice shaking as he pointed and a woman approached from the front and she started shouting at me as if I knew her."

"Next thing I know is I feel a pain in my abdomen and I see she has a tool and I have a metal bar sticking out of where the pain is, then cold and a blackness overran me".

"Can you describe the woman?" I asked "Young, Old, Tall or short?"

"Nope I do remember her saying something along the lines of Remember the cant though"
