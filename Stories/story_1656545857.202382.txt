A simple task. That’s all it was supposed to be. Expose ourselves, but falsely, pretending it’s all a game, a bit of fun and fantasy. That’s how the boss put it, when he took my joking idea seriously.  
But of course, when you think about it for longer than five seconds, you quickly realize it’s everything but. That being said, never let it be said that I’m a quitter, and if I’m given a task, by golly am I going to figure out how to do it.  
So, question one: exactly what form of media do we release this info as? We COULD make a movie or a tv series or perhaps even a video game or ten, heavens know we have the money for it. But after deliberating for about a day or two on that alone, in the midst of my daily duties, I quickly threw that out. Despite the fact that we have a plethora of front companies, and the fact that we would have no trouble making more, creating a brand new front company just for this dissemination effort is risky. Our fronts go out of their way to pretend to not have any idea of the otherworldly forces we use them to deal with, just so people can’t connect the dots between them. If we made a new one or two just to begin that association, suddenly those dots have numbers, and people can start to connect them. Not to mention, a new front with a ton of money for something with “high budget effects” coming out of nowhere would be suspicious in itself. Of course, that’s why I considered a game development studio and a game franchise instead at first… after all, those aforementioned forces would sure make for some entertaining game mechanics… but in the end that idea still suffered from the dot connecting problem.  
So, we needed to start small… out of the way. I quickly began to look into just what kind of small we could deal with.  
Then I discovered our means. And from there, everything just… fell into place.  
Urban legends on the internet. Creepypasta. Independent, speculative fiction dabbling in the world of horror. Of course.
