Alex Bones Reports - Star Carpenter Making Wooden Stakes

Alex: "So many people support giving this guy immortality. 'He makes our safest coffins', they say. I keep telling you to learn the whole truth, not just part of it." (Alex holds up a wooden stake.) "Have you lost a loved one to one of these? They're made of wood. Who makes things out of wood? A carpenter! With me is Count Fred - he has some interesting video to show."

Fred: "Thanks Alex. While my associate kept the carpenter busy, I took our hidden camera through this innocuous door in the show room." (Video close up of blue door.) "Through it, a horror story." (Video shows large show room with racks and racks of wooden stakes in all shapes and sizes.) "Our carpenter friend, the hero of all vampire kind, is double dipping. What's more, he's been putting the finger on us. How do you think Van Helsing and his rotten spawn have always found us in our most secret crypts? 'Buy a coffin today, get it delivered today. No BACK BACK BACK BACK orders! We'll cart off your old coffin free!!!???' Delivery indeed - he leaks our crypt addresses to all takers. Watch this, Alex."

Video shows a man in a restaurant - the carpenter. He's talking. "I deliver to these addresses, and then I have an address list. People pay good money to get that list."

Fred: "I rest my case, Alex."

Alex: "Our best friend? Our savior? HA!"
