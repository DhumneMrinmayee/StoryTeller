Rain was drenching my brown  cloak as i coutiously peaked around the brick wall there he was facing away from me  crouched over the body of a young woman blood and water dripping from his new formed claws

I tightened my grip around the steel sword in my right hand while my left vanished indo my pocket only to reappear with a small  Cristal vail

'Ok ok calm down Max the next time he drinks you will strike just one two steps swift strike and bam easy money  ' i thought to myself just as the Vampire   lifted the corps to get better access to the warm red liquid he desired so much

And just as planed i dashed around the corner and swung my sword over my head and downward for a clean decapitation as the head rolled and angry eyes starred at me  i quickly emptied the content of my vail on the still standing body

With disgust i watched as the holy water charred the vampires remains and the head slowly stopped moving

"hmm i better hurry and clean the corps before she starts jumping me" i mumbled to myself pulling a silver talisman from my pocket and speaking a prayer for her safe passage before placing the talisman in her open mouth and closing her eyes

"well now back to you little Bastard" i stepped over the young womans corps and parted the vampires heads lips with my sword  blinking back at me where some brilliant white but still short fangs

"must have been a new one to the pack huh?
Well sad for you to get killed before your transformation finished" i chuckeld to for a moment when i bolt my head around

" who is there!? "

My jaw  drops as there in the doorway  covered in blood and fleash stands my roomate Bill with his mouth whide agape a surprised look on his face and a sharp row of pointy deadly teeth blinking at me

"Bill why? How?" Was all i could stutter before he turned on his heel and darted of into the darkness

Totally perplex and unsure what to do i stood in the rain

' no no no not bill how he he cant be one of those monster he just cant ' i wispered

'What am i going to do now?
I have to kill him now poor Bill i am so sorry that this happened to you i swar to everything holy i will personally make the one responsible suffer '

But then i dont want to kill him he is my best friend since i moved to this town  shit what can i do

But then i remembered my hunter training and how to approach a vampire and decided on a plan

Two hours later i carefully opened my apartment door a silver knife in one and a bag of groceries in the oder hand 

Everything was dark all the lights turned off

Carefully i reached for the lightswitch ready to get pounced by an angry Vampire every second after some missed trys the lights finally flickered on and there he was sitting at the dinnertable in the middle of the room watching me with glowing red eyes 

"H-hey bill " i stammered holding the shaking silver knife in front of as i i am trying to hide myself from his gaze 

"i i am sorry Bill...  Who did this to you? Tell me and i will kill them with my own hands" 

"Max, Max, Max nobody did this to me damn already the second time this month well Max listen..." he slowly stood up and walked around the table slowly gliding towards me ".. I like you so i give you the quick rundown nobody did this to me i was born like this and the only.. "

" dont come closer "i scream in panik   

" i i will stab you Bill " but then suddenly my my arms went limb and my world started to slow down 

" bla bla bla where was i... Ah yes so Max the only reason you are still here is for me to generate enough money to afford this appartment by spawning one or two Vampires a week for you to hunt but no max you wont kill me because you where under my spell since the moment you moves to this city see you even brought me food how kind of you" 

now he was standing directly infeont of me but i couldn't do anything my body just didnt want to move as Bill slowly leaned forward and whispered 

"and now Max be so kind and forget that i am a Vapire and be a good thrall and make me some food"
