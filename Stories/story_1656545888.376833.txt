Next time you get your foreleg stuck in a clamp or your wing tangled in twine come on down to Otty Otterton's Quick Release. We even keep humans on-call 24/7 in case you can't get to us.

Now people often ask me, why those emotional and irrational people, and that answer is simple. Sure the lobster is better at cutting and the monkey is more dexterous. Of course the duck and bee will get there first. But none are as adaptable as a person. Yep, we do it so they can react to your unique needs and not because they work for green paper while the others want real payment.

So again, come to Otty Otterton's where you can't beat the price and our employees are only 20% less efficient than your average chimp.
