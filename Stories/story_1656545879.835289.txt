**"Now, sit!"** Bailou heard a doggy butt thump on the ground, followed by the whuppa-whuppa-whuppa of Silo's wagging tail.

"Roll over," Bailou commanded, rolling a hand he couldn't see, and he felt something furry thunk against his legs.

"Speak," he said.

"Arrrouf!" Silo said.

"How many fingers?" Bailou asked, holding up his index and pointer.

"Rrauf, rrauf."

"What if you added one more?"

"Rrauf, rrauf, rrauf."

"And if you subtracted four?"

Silo paused, the pant-pant-pant of a dog deep in thought the only sound. Tentatively, Silo barked, "Fuarr?"

Bailou rubbed his stubbly chin. "I suppose that's as good an answer as any. Here's a stumper for you: why are you so gosh-darn smart?"

In answer, Silo just eagerly panted, nudging Bailou with her wet nose.

"It's not me, you silly thing. I'm just an old man. Nothing special."

There came a *shuffa-shuffa-shuffa* as Silo shook her head.

"I mean, I've spent a good while with you. Nearly my whole life now. Which is more than I reckon a dog should naturally have."

Silo put her paws on Bailou's shoulders as he crouched down, staring with sightless eyes at the dog.

"'Course, I've been around for a good long while, too," Bailou muttered. "What year is it, anyway?"

In response, Silo tugged on Bailou's pant leg, dragging him towards the outside of his cozy little cave.

"No. No, I don't want to go outside. Those darn kids might still be around." Subconsciously, Bailou touched the eyes he'd once hadâ€”and would never have again.

Silo barked twice, more insistently this time.

"Alright, alright, alright. Fine." The old, *old* man stood and walked out of his cave, brushing aside the vines that had grown there.

When he reached the outside, he stopped. The hooting of unfamiliar tropical birds filled the air. Humidity like nothing he'd ever felt brushed at his skin.

"Wasn't this a desert, just the other day?" Bailou muttered, frowning.

*Shuffa-shuffa-shuffa,* went the playful shake of a dog.

Slowly, Bailou turned towards his loyal dog. "Silo."

"Rrauf."

"How many years... no. How many *centuries* has it been, since we first came to live in the Immortal Isles?"

Silo thought.

Then she began to bark.

"Rrauf, rrauf, rrauf, rrauf, rrauf." She paused, then hesitantly, added one more century. "Rrauf?"

The old man felt lightheaded. "No wonder you're so goshdarn smart. You've had all the time in the world to learn."

Silo nuzzled his hands, whining in sympathetic pain.

"Well. No wonder I feel so old." Bailou stood, stretching, and tilted his head, listening to the sounds of a foreign ecosystem. "Let's go exploring, shall we? There's a whole lot of future to catch up on."
