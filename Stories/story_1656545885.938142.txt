Look at me. How did this happen to me? I was once a sprite, young ten year old tackling my task with viral determination. Now what? How could I have become such a mess? My beard is furrier than a Rattata, my eyes redder than the fire off of a Ponyta, my bones feel as brittle as sand. How'd I get this bad?

*Gotta catch them all...*

Ah... Yes, that's how. My old age has started to fade my memory, and that cursed thing in my basement only draws me closer to insanity, but moments of clarity bring back that horrendous saying. Yes, that's what drove me to my descript state. How awful, and yet... I can't stop. I feel it inside of me, beating as fast as Beedrill wings -- I will catch them all.

"Um... Sir?"

What was that? 

"Are you okay sir?"

Oh, the boy who decided to follow me and seek scientific glory. What's his name again? "I'm okay son, don't worry. Just lost in thought again."

Yes. Somehow in this madhouse of impossibility I've become quite the distinguished scientist haven't I? I remember those years, when I was young and as unstoppable as a tumbling Gravler. 

I caught Pokemon that people had only theorized had existed, the infamous Red Gyrados was what put me on the main stage, but after that I just kept coming with them. The Lake Pokemon, the Rare and powerful bird Pokemon, the deep and menacing Kyogre... And fifteen years ago that awful Unknown Pokemon, the Pokemon that showed me what a dimension is... I wish I could take that discovery back. 

"Sir these numbers... They are... I think we did it!"

What are we doing again? That thing from the basement is already nagging at my ears. 

"It seems," He continued. "That they are in fact from space... Sir, this is incredible!"

In front of me I see a floating Solrock, its golden colors and shining eyes seeming almost mystical. "Space... Yes," I know that I'm mumbling again, but such are the habits that one develops when on an impossible task... Am I okay? "Write this down boy."

The obedient child runs to the journal. "Solrock," I begin. "Origins now completely confirmed. Space. The consequences of such a discovery are, of course, immense. Why have these cosmic visitors come down to stay? Have there been others that have visited and never returned? Is there an ecosystem of Pokémon among the stars as rich, if not richer, than the one down here? All of these question, now supported by the Solrock Confirmation, affirm the need for a new school of discovery I name, Astromonology -- The research of Pokémon from and living among the stars."

The boy writes all of it down, gleaming with obvious pride. "Sir we did it! They called us crazy, they called you crazy, but yet again you prove that their exists no better researcher and collector than yourself!"

I want to reply, but something far deeper holds my attention. From the stars... Arceus above, can I even get to some of those Pokémon? Are there hundreds more hanging above me like a taunting crib mobile?

"Sir?"

I shake myself out of the depressed stupor. "Yes. It is yet another great step in our work." I have more work to do. The kid must go for now. "As celebration, you have the day off. Please, go home and get some rest."

"But sir this discovery req--"

"Ah!" I raise my hand to silence him. "Go."

As he dredges out I begin to feel the pull from my basement. It's like tentacles circling me and begging to go deeper into the void. Yes, many call me insane, but my results always shut them up. Even with such credentials, if any found out about the basement, I'd be ostracized forever. 

I turn on the lights of the musty place, shutting and locking the door behind me. The kid always asks me what's down here. I'd never curse him with this burden.

*Welcome back.*

I see my tools and devices before me, all beeping and pulsing with decades of labor and precision. Is it all in my head? I wouldn't be surprised.

*We have work to do.*

I can hear it, though I wish I didn't. I sit down and begin my work, dutifully. Though, I don't do this for it, I do it for me. I must catch them all, no matter the costs or effort. Every Pokemon to ever live will belong to my name sooner or later. Even with age weighing on me like a stone, I refuse to give in to the absurdity of this task.

*You are close, I am almost free.*

"Yes," I finally reply to the phantom, my hands working on the grand device that it has been guiding me on making. "You will soon be free, Giratina."

Then you, like all Pokémon, will be mine. I will catch them all.
