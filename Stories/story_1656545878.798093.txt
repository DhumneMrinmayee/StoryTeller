"Well, we could put a positive spin on this," said the investigator. "At least you've solved the world's copper problem."

"You know how many people I've killed?" I asked. It was a rhetorical question, but after I said it, I was sort of curious.

The investigator shrugged. "Maybe a few dozen tourists. Some wildlife, and of course plenty of plants."

"How are you so nonchalant about this?" I asked. "I've destroyed a national treasure and killed more than 20 people! And - and think of the inflation I've just caused! It was one thing when I was only using a few quarters here and there." As I said it, I began to wonder if even that was okay.

"We're already in talks with the National Treasury to stop minting them, and we've created a notice for shops to stop taking quarters. At least until we come up with a replacement currency."

"Still!" I said, hopping down onto the pile of coins, turning my bag upright, and picking it up. "Are you so obsessed with the metal that you don't care about the human lives that were lost?"

I looked up to see a gun pointed at me.

"Did I say you could take that bag?"

"It's my bag," I said.

"That bag is now government property," he said. He never explained why, but I didn't dare ask or risk being shot. The investigator took my bag and walked off.
