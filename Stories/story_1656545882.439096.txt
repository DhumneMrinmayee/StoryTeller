**Fentilielle's wings buzzed idly as she counted out change from behind the livingwood receptionist's desk.** "There you are, Kanbri. Your change amounts to five sticks and two stones." She smiled politely, showing all two hundred and sixteen of her teeth. Somehow, the human man didn't seem reassured, so she handed him the change with one arm, gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder with her second, and pointed at the vine-wrought staircase with her third, fourth, fifth, and sixth arms. "Rooms are on the second floor; if you need housekeeping, whisper your true name and we'll hear. Have a nice stay at the Eternal Hotel!"

"Er, yeah. Thanks." Kanbri awkwardly took the wooden disks of currency from Fentilielle's hands and left.

"You're welcome, Kanbri!" Fentilielle savored the name as it left her lips, tracing the paths it left through soulspace as its memory echoed around the man. "Next!"

"Er." A very, *very* young child—not much older than a toddler, in Fentilielle's estimation—walked up to the desk. They were still at that age where it was hard to tell whether they'd grow up to become a boy or a girl or something else entirely. Fentilielle leaned forwards, steepling two of her hands beneath her chin in interest. She'd heard eye contact made humans more relaxed, but somehow, the full gaze of her compound butterfly's eyes didn't seem to make the human any less tense.

"Hi. I think I'm lost," the child said.

"Rooms are on the second floor," Fentilielle helpfully said.

"No, I meant—" The child clenched their fists, and Fentilielle frowned. Something... was off. The child's soulspace practically *blazed* with sorrow and confusion, and there was a... void in it, where someone living and caring should be. Someone the kid had recently lost. "I need somewhere to stay. Just for today."

"Well, you've come to the right place. Tell me..." Fentielle looked at the child, and took a wild guess. "Tell me, girl. What's your name?"

The child stiffened.

Then they whispered, "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

Fentielle frowned. She cleaned out one ear, then the other. Then she wiped down the fine network of sensory hairs that lined her body. "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you say that again?"

The child's soulspace *roiled* with distress, but they repeated, "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!"

Fentielle tried to wrap her mind around the syllables, fit them to the person in front of her, but their paths through soulspace didn't meet. This name was not suited for the soul that stood before her. "I'm sorry," Fentielle said, "but I need your true name."

"That—that's the name my father gave me," the child whispered miserably.

And Fentielle understood.

"But you're not a girl, are you?" Fentielle asked. "And that name doesn't belong to you."

The boy shook his head, and his unwillingness to meet Fentielle's eyes had nothing to do with her lepidopteran apperance.

"Then tell me, little boy." Fentielle tilted her head. "What *is* your true name?"

Silence hung in the Eternal Hotel.

Then the boy whispered, "Cienne."

*Ah.* Fentielle savored the name in satisfaction as it *clicked*, resonating with the boy's soul. "Cienne," Fentielle repeated. "For that alone, I give you a day's sanctuary for free."

Cienne looked up. "Really?" He asked, disbelief written in his soul.

"Really. Your room is on the second floor." She paused, then added, "And if you need anything... whisper your name. Your *true* name. And we will hear."

Cienne gave her a tentative smile. "Thank you."

"The pleasure was mine," she said.

She watched the boy leave, his soul bright with the possibilities of a new day.

It was always a joy discovering a new name.
