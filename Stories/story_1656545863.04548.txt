There he goes, steak and cross at the ready and that backpack no doubt filled with a restaurant’s supply of garlic. He had gotten word of the Jamerson family’s true identity and now motivated by fear, the idea of glory or both and is making his way towards their manor with viscous intent.  
 I can’t blame him really, I freaked out when I found out when my buddy Eric was a lycanthrope. However, I quickly realised he was still well… himself. I’ve met many more ‘monsters’ since then and it’s become even clearer that they’re just everyone else. The Jamerson’s for example are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met.  
Hopefully that fact will help me with this one and I can stop him from getting someone hurt.
