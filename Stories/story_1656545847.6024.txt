V= Vampire ( Has special abilities like floating and being able to regrow bones instantly, and use them for attack)

VH= Vampire Hunter ( Has all sorts of Weaponry and has Holy Magic)

* The Vampire just gets back from the grocery store and sets his groceries on the counter*

V- I’m Home! Come get your Kool-Aid!

VH- Coming!

*V walks down the stairs with special jive in his step, as his second favorite red drink has arrived*

V: Thanks!

VH: As long as you don’t take my red fluid, I’m good. *in an audible whisper* blood sucking bastard

V: Say that again, man child?

VH: Your ass is lucky I don’t have the money to take you out

V: And why is it that you need that money? Remind me again? Oh right, your parents are dead and you need to pay for the funeral? What was their age? 53? I’m 5300. Don’t have to worry about that. What’s their kill average in the ground? Maybe they’re vampires now? That would be funny! *V starts laughing voraciously*

VH: *seething with rage* Well, it’s not everyday your roomie kills your family, is it. But you’ll be able to relate, soon enough

V: *visibly confused* What?

VH: I did some digging. You’re a Klabautervann, right. Of the Klabautervann family?

V: *visibly concerned* What the hell do you mean?

VH: *smirks* Are you familiar with a Lila Klabautervann?

V: * sweating* Y-yes. That’s my sister. We’ve been friends since 3006 B.C.

VH: You know, *turns around to face V*, She was worth, what was it? Ah, here it is. *Takes a poster out of pocket.* In the Vampire Hunter world, we have a ranking and bounty system based on how dangerous certain Vamps are. The Klabautervann family is a celebrity family, but in a very bad way. Your sister was 932 million, 50 thousand, 638 dollars, exact. Enough for me to move out of this god forsaken country. So, you know what this means?

V: YOU SON OF A BITCH

V and VH at the same time: THE DEAL IS OFF!

V: I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR TOO LONG. I’LL SAVOR TURNING YOU INTO A PRUNE, YOU RAGGEDY SHEEP FUCKER!

VH: Try it, you old bitch! 

* V extends his claws and swipes at VH. VH dodges and takes out an axe from his belt holster. He swings at V, only for him to float away and dodge. V shoots one of his phalanges like a bullet at VH. VH uses a nearby table as a sheild and pushes V out of a window. VH looks out of the window and V jumps up to bite him. But VH takes the ace and swipes at his face. 
V screams, and runs away, with a nasty scar on his face. V has won, but has a long way to go against the Klabautervann family, and all Underworld scourges that exist *
