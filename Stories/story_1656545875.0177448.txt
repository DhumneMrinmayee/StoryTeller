You take a quick whiff of the feces and can't help but roll your eyes at the bag of turds. All it took was that one quick to realize that the notification on your phone was too good to be true. You quickly decided to give whatever spawned this a piece of your mind.

You say with a shit eating tone, your knowledge of fecal matter saving you from being duped once more. Clearly whatever entity that entertained itself by summoning bovine feces didn't know the proper terminology for cattle genders.
