 I curse the child to become an apex predator of a magical creature, as appropriate to his situation, and possessing his own terrifying human intelligence when threatened, to return to human form when he next sleeps, unless he likes the form

To find an have a harem of 12 men he finds beautiful, loves, who love him and get along well with each other, that they shall Mary, and have 4 wonderful adopted children to raise, after his parents death.

That he shall find himself able to become great , though not permanently the best, in any skill he wishes to study. However, in the night, he shall visit the dreams of every person in his domain, and effectively teach them, to be as good as he is at the skill, if only for a month

And, that when he comes of age to take over the family, any who willingly stand in his way to take over, or, attempt to force others to take his place and be crowned king , or contest his reign for his first 5 years, shall perish, having there plans come to naught. 

( Now, his parents can never show him off at fancy functions, but, he shall never be threatened. He shall find love and have his lust fully slacked in life, but, his parents bloodline will end, and, they shall never meet there grandchildren. He will not bring great prestige for a talent, as, all in the kingdom have that talent, however, the people will view him as a giver of knowledge and prosperity, and, he will still find himself satisfyingly good with what he studies. And, finally; he may not be put away, and, shall be known publicly as king, with no threat to him, nor questions of his legitimacy. : )   )
