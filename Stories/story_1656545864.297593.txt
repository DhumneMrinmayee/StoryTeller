I inhale. "Listen here, you ungrateful brats. This guy over here has been protecting you for five f-ing years *straight*, and you're *complaining* about it?"

"A fight with you almost knocked the license plate off my car."

"He makes me have a headache when he time-travels."

"Well, guess what? All of that was to protect you, idiots! So what do you have to say, huh? Guy's been saving you from giant mechs and radiation monsters for years, so what garbage is gonna come out of your face hole?"

"Butâ€“"

"*Do you think people like me just are evil for the fun of it?* No! Because we *were* good citizens, until all of *you* decided to respond by complaining about things out of our control! I wasn't even *born* in a city with a superhero to save my hide, and you're still flapping your godforsaken mouth!"

"So will you be leaving now? It's messing up my schedule," a teenage girl said.

I let out a deep breath. "How have you been dealing with this? These people are a freaking pain to live with."

The crowd stared at him now, almost begging. They used to insult him when they were safe, but now...

"It won't happen again." I spread my mechanical wings. "Come on, I have to post a dis-recommendation at the Superhero Association."

The superhero grinned. "Sure. Lunch at Burger King?"

"Sure." 

And at that moment, I knew we had become allies.
