If I had super strength, the bindings wouldn't contain me. If I had mind control, I could tell someone to let me free. But I have nothing useful that can aid me. All I have is a pissed off nation and an uncertain future.

The government agent seems to think I purposely committed treason. He doesn't understand that I had no intention on betraying our country. But what's done is done.

He asks me how I knew of highly classified information and why I revealed it.

"I only tell them what they need to hear. It's not much of a choice. No matter the question, I'm obligated to give an answer. Either I'm the bearer of bad news, or the one who brings enlightenment. Take that as however you will."

Then something gleams in the agent's eyes. He seems to be putting two and two together.

"If that's the case, how do we counteract the terrorists who now know how to disable our electrical grids, our gas pipelines, and disable our nuclear codes?"

The answer came immediately.

"You can't. It's too late." I pause and my face falls. No. It can't be. I wish I'm wrong, but the truth is always correct. But there had to be hope. The agent grimaces then asks another question.

"Will the world end soon?" I cross my fingers and let it loose.

"No, but the human population will plummet dramatically." He swears. 

"Will I live?" 

"No." Suddenly the door busted open and gunfire cut through the agent. Before I knew it, I was being seized by masked men. Whatever their motive, it won't be nice.

At that moment I accepted that I'm just a tool for those who want answers. There's nothing I can do but comply.

Unless I'm saved.
