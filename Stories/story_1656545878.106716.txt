I felt the cold sweat on the back of my neck as I looked through my gaming library. I had to make a choice. 

I don't know how it happened - the shift. One day, I just woke up and opened my bedroom to an empty canvass of nothingness. It was like my room opened to the edge of a cliff on a starless night. God knows how long I spent staring at the empty space, trying to wake up with no success. 

Time passed, not sure how long since all the clocks stopped working. I ate all the snacks laying around trying to stave off the thirst, and even endavoured in drinking the energy drink can that has stayed open on my desk since my last gaming binge: a week before the world dissapeared. 

Out of boredom and helplessness, I stated doing what I do best when I try to ignore what life throws at me: gaming. That's when it happened. As soon as I started Outlast, I heard the maniacal laughter, moans and groans. But they weren't coming from my computer. No. They were coming from outside. 

Anxiously, I cracked the door open, only to be met with the grungy halls of the abandoned hospital in the game.  It took me a while before I figured out that whatever game I played, ended up on the other side of the door.

I ran out of food. I was desperate. I cursed myself for only playing horror games. I really needed water. 

It seems that this time, escaping the real world through computer games became a prison instead.

'Fuck.' I clutched my baseball bat harder as I closed the door after me.
