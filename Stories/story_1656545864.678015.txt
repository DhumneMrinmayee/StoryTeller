“Not good enough”, Cyberpunk Sam said with an icy voice that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled CEO Cyberpunk Colin to the bone. 

“Well, then”, CEO Cyberpunk Colin began to reply with an icy voice that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone.

 “It looks like it’s time to kill you.” CEO Cyberpunk Colon finished replying with an icy voice that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone. 

Cyberpunk Sam shot CEO Cyberpunk Colin in the head and a red cloud splashed the window behind him. This was a cold image, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone.

CEO Cyberpunk Colins’ smoking hot blonde wife, Cyberpunk Sheila, stepped out of the shadows, her boobies bouncing in an icy way that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone. 

“Well, well big boy”, Cyberpunk Sheila said with an icy voice that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone. “Looks like I’m yours forever and ever as you killed CEO Cyberpunk Colin.” Sheila continued with an icy voice that was cold, and frosty, and it chilled Cyberpunk Sam to the bone. 

Cyberpunk Sam began to do Cyberpunk Sheila right there and then. On the table, on the floor. Hell, we even banged in the hallway outside. 

After Sam had given Cyberpunk Sheila what she wanted, he pointed his Cyberpunk Pistol at her head, and pulled the trigger in an icy way that was cold, and frosty, and it killed Cyberpunk Sheila until she was bones. 

A red cloud splashed the window behind her. This was a cold image, and it shook Cyberpunk Sam to the bone.

Cyberpunk Sam had saved the world again. And he even got some tail.
