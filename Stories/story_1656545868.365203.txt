Well, this is.... pleasant. At least I can get some sleep now- hard to worry about getting eaten by a giant lizard when you're already in their belly. That invulnerability is really paying off, I'm glad that was part of my wish too. I would have been mutilated by its teeth, but even if that didn't get me the stomach acid and lack of air would have. 

Should I even bother trying to get away next time or should I just let it happen and take a nice long nap again? It's not exactly comfortable but it's not fun outside either. Should've paid more attention to my son when he was jabbering on about dinosaurs, maybe I could've used some of that. 

My son... Well, I was going to personally make sure him, and his children, and his children's children, were protected with this gift, but I'll have to wait a while before I can do that. These don't seem like the dinos from that dinosaur move franchise, I can't even remember the name, but how long does that give me with the dinosaurs? Who knows. 

I do know I have at least 65 million years ahead of me if I want to see my son again. Will I be the same in tens of millions of years? How could I possibly walk in after the day I left like nothing had changed for me? Like I hadn't seen eons pass and all of human history unfold before my eyes. Will I even remember him after so long? 

Will I remember who ***I*** was? 

It seems I won't have a choice in finding out. I forgot to ask for a way out of this immortality. Silly of me, but I wanted to see the end of the universe too. I don't know why an extra few tens of millions of years, maybe a hundred, would make such a difference. Still, it would've been easier to adjust to the idea without such a shocking change of scenery. 

I did have the foresight to ask for extended hibernation, what with the plan to see how things end. I had thought to do it from a distant solar orbit after we'd developed sufficient spacecraft, but I guess it can't be so bad on the surface of an Earth I know survives. I can just sleep for a 65 millions years at first, then wake up every million years or so to see what's going on. If I've got proto-humans to keep me company, I should be able to last a couple hundred thousand years awake, right? At least Chicxulub doesn't pose a threat to me. 

I'll just find a cave somewhere and hope for the best.

Well this was unanticipated. Either I was right at the end of the dinosaurs and I overshot my sleep, or there really was an ancient technological society on Earth before humans. Fascinating. This room is comfortable and clearly designed to be human living quarters, but the door is locked, and there's a slight coating of dust on everything, including myself. After knocking, twice, with no immediate response, I relax in the... well, it's not a beanbag chair, but it is the best imaginable version of a beanbag chair. Complete support as the chair itself mushes around you, gently supporting every inch. 

After only a short wait, the door unlocks, and a mostly unremarkable woman enters. She doesn't look like much, thirty something, dirty blonde, until I watched how she walked. The only way to describe it was old. Not the frailness of old age, but the grace of having moved so many times as to only move with purpose, in the most effective manner. 

"You made a good choice," she prompted, after having made herself comfortable in one of the other chairs in the room. 

"Seemed like a silly choice soon after I made it," I warily responded. 

"Oh, I meant the hibernation thing. The Djinn made fools of all of us on the immortality count." 

My brain began to reel. "All... of... us?" I managed to squeak out. 

"Of course, Immortality is one of the most popular wishes, you know. Fewer manage to word their wishes in such a way that they can actually make use of their immortality, and very few were prescient enough to realize a few centuries off might make a difference." She'd clearly done this "introduction to immortality" more than once. 

"How many of us are there?" I gasp excitedly. "What year is it?!?" 

"A few thousand now, and about 35 million years BC. We don't know for sure, there were only a few astronomers and none of them came from the right era where they might actually remember the necessary data to calculate exactly." She sighs and continues, "The ones who remember things, never knew the data, and those who would know had everything stored on computers." 

"So then what is this place? How did you find me?"

"The Conclave is ***old.*** Djinn have been pranking people this way for a long time- hah, not that time is relevant there, people get sent back to whenever from whenever, but everyone gets sent back in time. They think it's hilarious, but I think they underestimated human persistence. We put some of the pieces together, thankfully the Djinn's sense of humor sending people from later in human history, to earlier times, seems to have helped us out. You're from what, the early 2000's?" 

I was shocked she had guessed so close. "2022, How did you know?" 

She smiled. "We pinpointed your landing and actually picked you up only a few days after you entered hibernation and you've been sleeping in this very chamber for a full 65 million years. We dust the sleepers off once a year, they wake when they wake. The 'earliest' immortals had a significant knowledge of the Djinn, as they came from around 5,000 'CE.' Yes we still call it that, our own calendar... that can wait. They had been sent back the furthest. We think future humanity found a way to deal with them, or perhaps it took us immortals that long to finally crack it. We can track some of what they do now, but they're extradimensional beings. We saw the flash on our sensors when you popped in and you didn't make it very far." 

We sat a while in silence, me desperately trying to process this new information, her with the patience of someone who has sat waiting for millennia already. It was hard to not notice how focused she was even with nothing in particular to focus on. Clearly relaxing, but ready to jump immediately back into explanations when I readied myself.

"I guess something to keep my mind busy wouldn't be so bad," I finally decided. Her eyes snapped open and she smiled again. "What's the plan?" I asked.

"Foremost is preservation of our progress. You've got eternity ahead of you so  you might as well spend the next hundred years or so catching up on what we know, just in case the Conclave is lost again. This is the third Conclave, so this isn't hypothetical." 

"A hundred years?!?" I exclaimed. 

"We know a ***lot*** and redundancy is imperative. A hundred years to become a master of the universe isn't much." She holds her hand up, and a ball of light forms, gently illuminating her face with a pale yellow glow. My jaw dropped. 

"Did you also ask the genie for that?" I asked.

"No, though you might still call it a Djinn ability. We found it by studying them." She extinguished the light.

I began to piece things together and realized there were missing pieces, with a human (immortal or not) being able to conjure light like it's nothing, and outright saying it's Djinn.

"What do you mean Djinn ability?" I asked suspiciously, thinking this might still be an elaborate Djinn trick and her a Djinn. 

She looked sharply at me. "Well, you've already sniffed it out, so I'll just tell you now. You're immortal. That doesn't mean you're bound to this plane. The Djinn are extradimensional, yes, but they were once humans. At least some of them." 

The look of shock my face seemed to prompt her to continue.

"We don't know about all of them once being humans but yes, we know how to become Djinn. We can't die but there's nothing holding us here, and whether Djinn are all higher planar humans or that humans can become Djinn, we don't know. Many of the Djinn who send humans back were themselves sent back. The earliest immortals have all long since... moved on." 

"So you could start granting wishes right now if you wanted to?" I puzzled aloud. "Why would you stay a human?" 

She paused and seemed to contemplate her own existence. The pause extended, longer and longer, before finally she said in a very quiet voice, as if barely hanging onto the world.

"Eternity's a long time, and you can't change your mind."
