And so I keep walking a smile across my face. My shoes have long since fallen to dust. My feet are callused from centuries of constant use. I don’t feel anything below my waist anymore. But I continue to walk, holding the remnants of a leash in one had.  He had to wish that we always were doing our walks. Damn dog.  But that wasn’t the cruelest thing.  A dog’s mind is simple and self sacrificing.  He wished I’d never be sad.  Jerk. My family tried to get me to stop but, I could only smile at them.  The cried, they yelled, they screamed, only to see my oblivious smile and kind words. My daughter finally ran me over with her truck.  My body was strewn across the pavement as she spat in my decimated smiling face and drove off, thinking that I was finally dead.  Over the next months my body grew back again slowly. The pain was excruciating but, you would never know by looking at my smile.   Dogs are better than cats they said.  A cat will eat your face when you die. A dog will wish you live forever.
