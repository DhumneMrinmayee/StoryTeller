My armor set is a mishmash of old gear from several adventures, the grave diggers shoes. The top hat of refinement and  the shirt of the common men. My pants are just regular leather pants. However I have this sword called the Wongler, no Idea what it dose but the blade while being properly made has a bit of wiggle in it as if it were loose, I killed a slime with it and when I stabbed at it, the blade on its own went straight for its core. Right now I al stalking a goblin to find itâ€™s cave to see what goblin treasures I can find, but the blade seems to be pointing directly at its heart.
