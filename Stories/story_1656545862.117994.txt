"I don't understand," you say. "Why do I have this sudden urge to boop your nose?"

"That's a very human reaction." The alien chuckles. "But not all humans react that way."

You're not sure what it means, but you decide to take a chance anyway. You reach out with your right hand, placing it against the alien's nose. You feel its rough surface under your fingers as you slowly pull it back. Your heart pounds in your chest.

You make contact with the nose again, then again. Each time you touch it, you get closer to booping it. Soon enough, you're touching it so often that you can't help but give into temptation. You bring your finger up and gently tap the tip of the nose. It feels different this time, it's smooth like glass.

Your heart pounds harder than ever before. You don't know why, but you're sure something's wrong. You quickly move your finger away from the nose.

"I'm sorry," you say. "I shouldn't have done that."

The alien shrugs. "It's okay. You did nothing wrong."

You turn around and walk away, trying to calm yourself down. As soon as you leave the room, you feel better. But when you return, the alien is waiting for you. You sit at the table across from him. He places his hands on the table and looks directly at you.

"What happened?" he asks.

You try to explain to him what happened, but you find it difficult to put into words. "I was just trying to boop your nose."

He laughs. "I can see that. Humans are curious creatures. You love to learn new things and experience new sensations."

You nod. "So, what does that mean? Why did I suddenly want to boop your nose?"

"Well, I'm not an expert, but my guess would be that it's because you've never touched another creature like me before.  That's normal."

"Okay," you say. "Thank you."

The alien stands up. "If you need anything else, let me know. And if you're interested in continuing our conversation, please come by any time."
