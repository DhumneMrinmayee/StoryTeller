When I first discovered my power, I didn't think much of it. It was an information type power - ask any question, get a 100% accurate response. So, naturally, I first asked it how to get Calliope to be my girlfriend. *Ask her out,* said the little voice in my head. Flustered, I asked it why that would work. *Because she wants you to be her boyfriend.*   


It was silly, you know? I didn't really want anything else out of it than a little courage and a set of instructions, and my gift has always been happy to oblige. It's been a few years. We're engaged, she wants a baby, and I don't know if I want that just yet - and I'm afraid to ask - but I know I want her in my life for as long as I have it. You should see the way her smile lights up a room. And I might have all the information in the universe, but she's the one asking all the smart questions. We're a power team, together.  


Now, you know I'm hardly the only information type super, there are lots of others. World doesn't really need more of those around, as I soon found it. It comes with the gift we tend to be pretty clever. Again, my Calliope is the actually clever one of the two of us, but I like to think I'm wise. I knew it was the right choice to ask how long I would make it as a cape. *Once you make your public debut as a cape,* it told me, y*ou will cause a nuclear apocalypse within two weeks which will kill you, or you will avert it. If you do avert it, the Thirteen Horsemen will kill you a month after that, to protect their secrets.*  


I don't know how I didn't break down in that moment, or how I did the things that followed. I have a theory, you know, that maybe it's one of the required secondary powers of information types. Just like super strong have to be super tough to avoid destroying their own bodies with their powers, I think we information types have to have the raw nerve to accept the knowledge we get. So I asked another question - am I in danger now?  


*Yes. By asking the previous question, you have become aware of your own potential for destruction. This has marked you as a the third greatest threat to humanity to the information super that reports to the Global Union. They will convene in the next fifteen minutes, and have the Scions of the World at your current location within twenty minutes.*  


"How do I stop them?" I whispered, afraid.  


*You cannot.*  


"How do I stop them from hurting me or Calliope?" I trembled as I asked, but I had to know. I could hear her soft footsteps coming up the stairs. I wonder if she had heard me.  


*Talk to them. They will try to recruit you. Explain the dangers, and that you can't join for humanity's good. That will buy you four days.*  


My beautiful, wonderful fiance opened the door, all smiles and charm, and for the first time I was not comforted. I knew she saw it on my face, because her own face fell. I couldn't look at her, in that moment, and she sat down beside me. And she said, "Is it better if I ask, or wait for you to explain?"  


*Always ask. Always communicate with her.*  


It was relationship advice. I almost giggled out of the absurdity, and the pressure we were under. And then I explained everything. It took a few precious minutes. I knew, by time I was done, that other information super had already gathered all the necessary people together. Now they were explaining what they had found. About me. And clever Calliope, she asked the most important question. "Can we make it through this, together?"  


*Yes.*  


And with that, I knew everything was going to be ok.
