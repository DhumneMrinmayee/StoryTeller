With a cold, mirthless smile, the vampiress bared her fangs and leaned in close ever so slowly, savoring the wide-eyed look of horror on her victim's face. 

Except... she jerked back fast in surprise as she realized: the man's wide-eyed look was not one of fear, but rather fascination. He was not trembling or begging for mercy. There were no tears in his eyes. He simply stood, transfixed, staring at her the way one might stare at the starry night sky. He was more nervous than he was terrified. 

Exasperated, the vampiress asked "why aren't you more afraid? You're supposed to be afraid! I'm a vampire! I could kill you!" 

It took the man a moment to speak, as he had to clear his throat two or three times, and force the words out through a bit of stuttering. "Well, yes, y-you could, but- well- I mean-" 

"SPIT IT OUT!" she demanded.

"Well," started the man, "so could a- a lot of other p-people..."

The vampiress reeled back. Did this... *mortal...* just say what she thought he'd said? He wasn't afraid of her because she was no more dangerous than a mere petty *criminal?* But she sensed his hesitation. There was something he was holding back. "And...?" She prompted. "There's not another reason?"

Now he was *really* nervous. He began tugging on his shirt collar, wringing his hands, clearing his throat, and curiously, blushing a bright tomato red. "Um... well... see, the thing is... you're really hot."
