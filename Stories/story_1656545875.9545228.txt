I raise my tea cup for the fourth time this week. He sits there, leather suit, black mask, impossibly sharp blade resting on my dining room table. Once you get the necessaries out of the way, they're really quite civil. 

The Black Death, or "Peter" as he devulged, is a quaint hairstylist with a sick child promised to be made better if he assassinated me. I compliment them often, when they come to me with new plans on my annihilation. Their skills are well honed, best of the best, cream of the crop. 

But.. they all end in the same way. The civil ones have a drink with me. The others... Well, I have a large back yard. 

Peter is different you know? I just have a gut feeling. The poor man has put everything on the line for this. Really put in his research you know? He gathered intel that I have a weakness for slovenite steel. A very alien metal smelted from an off world rock that I gently put down in the grand canyon before it tried to obliterate everything. 

It sits shattered on my kitchen floor like a cheap dinner plate. 

I told him that I hope humanity eventually gives up on my extermination. I had done the world a favor, afterall, by saving it from itself for at least three centuries. You'd think it would allow me just a decade of peace and quiet? He agreed. After taking another bite of the exquisite cake I baked for his arrival. Ingredients from three different countries AND an asteroid I had been cultivating a very unique salt. 

He thanked me for my hospitality and I sent him on his way. 

I was curious about faking my death at this point. Peter brought up some very good ideas. I think tomorrow I'll call him up on his cell and see if he'd be down for putting this slovenite plan into action. His family, afterall, could really use the money.
