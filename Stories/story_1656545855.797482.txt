“Okay…” I murmured as I walked back and forth, “What could I say.”

“Come on Mykie, there is no lie for you,”my partner, Dominic reasoned.

“For once he’s right mate. Just tell the truth,” my friend Kris agreed. I know they’re right, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. 

“Easy for you two to say, you got easy powers!” I deflected. They both just looked at each other and shrugged, I was right anyway. Kris can cancel gravity, so she says super strength. Dominic can teleport, so he says super speed. Sha-bing sha-boom, done. But it’s not that easy for me. I’m barely allowed to even go outside until next week, and that’ll just be on missions! The council says that my powers make me too passionate, that I’m too unpredictable, that I could reveal myself. As much as I want to argue,  I can’t. I know they’re right, I care too much for my own good. I just can’t sit still while humanity treats them this way…

“Fine, fine. I guess I can’t lie." I mumbled as a flipped into a chair in defeat.

“Finally!” Dominic cheered, “Now, onto our names, I was thinking we could make something stereotypical and them combine the words…”

*One week later*

Once Kris, (now known as Srow), was an official hero, Dominic and I were up next.

“I am proud to announce that Slash and Annack are now official superheroes!" The head of the council proclaimed.

Here I was, Annack. Here we go, Dominic’s bound to get in trouble soon…

A/N
I want to see if anyone can guess Mykies powers! Annack is animal attack by the way, and they technically have two, but they go hand in hand. Good luck! -Max
