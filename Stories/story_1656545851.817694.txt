ATTENTION PEOPLE OF THE WORLD! 
 COWER BEFORE DOCTOR NECROSIS!  I INTERRUPT YOUR PITIFUL LIVES WITH A MESSAGE!

Recently, my arch-nemesis, the Racer, has made public his ongoing struggles with depression. I would like to publicly applaud this action and express my support for his difficulties. Despite our many conflicts, I respect the Racer and admire the the courage needed to talk about these issues in our society. 

While there has been some positive reception for his work to normalize mental healthcare, the general response has been disgustingly negative. The attitudes on display create a toxic environment that only exacerbates mental health issues and perpetuates the stigma around seeking necessary care. 

Those whinging about how "weak" this generation of heroes is are the real cowards. What the Racer did last week took more courage than staring down any Death Ray that I ever constructed. 

Those seeking to turn his issues into an opportunity to further suppress open discussion of those issues are the real villains. 

As such, I am pleased to introduce my guest, Gabe, whose public comments about the Racer I will not repeat. He is about to demonstrate my newest creation, this substance reconfigures and blocks dopamine receptors in the brain. If you believe depression is something one just "gets over" then I wish you good luck, Gabe. 

Bully the Racer at you own risk. THIS HAS BEEN DOCTOR NECROSIS!
