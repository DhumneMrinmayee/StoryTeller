Quiet. Fast. 

Smoke of fire. Fire of destruction. Close so close. 

Wrong. Fire of food. Fire of familiarity. Fire of family. 

Flashes through my mind. An eternity. Years beyond counting. An endless expanse of nothing. But my mind. 

I close my eyes as I begin to feel the leaves around me. Smell the fire of resin and moss and burning fat. The sound of humans. The smell of humans. I recognize my mind for the first time in an eternity. I remember the lives. 

The empty cities I build. The trades I mastered. The sciences I perfected. The pointlessness of it all. The great apocalypses. The deaths. The slips into a deep insanity. 

I shed a tear. All gone. But I am here. The future is finally here.

I step out of the bush much to the surprise of the early humans gathered around one the first fires to be lit by someone else. The men jump up to protect women who I now recognize to be pregnant or carrying children. I had forgotten.

I open my mouth and a gravely cry spills out. How many millions of years since I’ve spoken. I suddenly realize I don’t think in a language I know. My confusion only increases these humans fear of me. And then he stabs at me with his crude pointed stick. 

It lands in my eye and I don’t flinch. He pulls it back and follows up with one to the throat and stomach. Blood runs down my chest and pools on the ground. I have realized my mistake. I have forgotten how fragile I, we, used to be. As my wounds close and the shriek of true early human terror hits my ears.

My soul has finally woken. I feel emotion. The depth of my existence all at once. I begin to weep as my eye reforms in my skull.

They cower before me, the wrongness of my existence on full display before me. It is too early. I turn to leave their alien cries shaking me to my core. All I have wanted, for longer than my memory stretches. The webs of madness and primal fear creep into every crevice of my being and as I disappear into the bush I sink low and disappear. I pray the damage is minimal but I stay to watch. 

Decades pass, they are nothing to me. Centuries. Millennium. Madness will not take me. I have purpose. It is torture. The packs of humans forage and travel and hunt and forage. How long has it been since the first fire. I remember only that it happened.

A law. A farm. A village. Cities. Civilization. A modern age. I absorb their languages. And I remember the texts I’ve stored. The vast tomes of knowledge I have accumulated. I re learn all. Has it been decades. I give my self a new name.

I spread and develop. I learn and record. I engage and live. But they slip to dust and fade from memory. I long for the madness. I despise the loneliness. I have retreated to the wild more times than I can count. But I always return. And fast even for me. A year. Half that. A month. Days.

The pull of humanity after so long alone. I drink it like a dying man his blood. Like these rulers their wine. Like a babe his mothers milk.

Then I am back. Recorded history. Fast too fast. Cities are erected in seconds. Rulers rise and fall. Technology. Art. Philosophy. I desperately want to contribute but not yet. I know the good I could do but not yet. They are not yet ready.

And then I am back. The second I have been waiting for. I watch as I disappear. And then I enter and greet my wish granter. It has been so long. I ask the question that had gnawed at my insides for all those years. 

“Why?”

And he is gone. 

My mother calls me for diner and I greet her. She is a stranger to me. She sees this and asks me what is wrong. What is wrong?

I look at my hands and realize I am a relic that has barely started his journey. My only goal for millions of years was to make sure humans came to be. Then to record all and give what was needed to grow. Now I am back to the time I wished to get and I forget what the first goal was. It matters not.

“Of course mom I’m finally feeling myself.”

It is not a lie. I have my name again. I had forgotten it long ago but it settles into me like a foot into an old boot. I will live this life slowly and enjoy what I had taken for granted. The future can wait. I let go of the past and crash into this moment. A violent awakening in only a few seconds. But those seconds felt long. It has been so long that time seemed to creep slowly.

A life well lived. They all now know. I rise like an old god from the sea. Ancient and abyssal. Terrifying. But a calm soon washes over. Like the foam from a beach.

Was it seconds or another eternity. I sit upon a simple chair I made myself. Old carved wood. An empire that spans the stars. Humanity is not perfect, I have not tried to perfect them. A tranquil fist crushes those who would bring their own order to my selected chaos. 

I gaze at my newest piece I know not how long it has been since I started but it is finally done. A nebula. Carefully calculated space dust. Or were they stars. It will last. 

I have stagnated. A throne among the stars. A people forgotten. The madness creeps once again. I weep and wail. A soul broken. Why would anyone wish this. 

A renewal. Brief but life giving. An inspiration. Work. 

Stagnation again. Ruin again. Destruction again. I have stopped watching. I meditate among the stars. Eternity’s slip by me. I am visited by aliens. Ancestors. I am a god. 

I despise existence. I seek an end. The people fear my loss. The only constant. A god of flesh. I am given another wish. 

“Renewal.”

 I allow the granter full control. And my world disappears. An end.

A beginning. The wail of a newborn. The death of an old woman. I have consciousness again. It repeats. Each time new. Some short painful sorrowful. Others long passionate jubilant. An exponential increase to eternity. Another wish.

“The End.”

I close my eyes for the first time. I open my eyes for the last. My life draped around me like a shadow. Stretched long. Yet short so short. A thing. I am not alone. Finally time crawls again. Family. Love. Growth. I remember why I wished for an eternity. A fool no longer.
