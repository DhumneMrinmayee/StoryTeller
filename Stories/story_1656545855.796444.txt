“You see, my power I can, uh how can I put this I can umm err, it’s kinda hard to explain” it is in fact NOT hard to explain. I can produce pheromones that have whatever effect I want at will. Most of them are undetectable by most animals and once they get into your nose they will eventually get to your brain. At which point the effect takes hold. However I can’t say mind control, I’ll get shot on site. I can’t say what it really is because then people will plug their nose. Wait, I just had an Idea. 

“Hmm, so you know how sound works right? I can make micro vibrations which can target and activate certain neurons in your brain, and while everyone’s is different, after doing some digging I can influence your body to do certain tasks while, however if my influence is caught the individual they can easily fight it. But in many cases, my influence feels like your own subconscious’s automatic functions. Not quite mind control but very close.”

It’s perfect, this power would require air to work, and my opponents can’t live without air. But now they won’t try to filter out my pheromones which, doesn’t entirely require air to work. 

I quickly made the inquisitor believe my story, his power being the ability to be immune to any power he thinks of.
