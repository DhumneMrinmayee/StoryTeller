I guess that's the naivet√© of being a young dragon. There was always next week to play Offices &amp; Humans. Youth was the epoch that would never end, until it did. 

Six weeks later, Ga'myrzal floated the idea of our next session, but dad was taking me treasure hunting that weekend, and Bal was summering in a crag near Mt. Flake. A meme in our group chat popped up. It was a Tome titled, "Groups Fall Apart" but instead of the usual cover, it was a few dragons sitting around the table rolling dice. I chortled to myself but never responded.

The epochs came and went, and we aged slowly, the way dragons do. But time still slipped like gold coins through my claws.

I heard that Zarf'fall was slain by a group of adventurers, and I tried to remember if he had any family, but couldn't. I'm not sure why, maybe to remember him, I told my wife Zenthara about how OP his White American was, and how he basically broke the game climbing the fabled Corporate Ladder. But Zenthara has never played O&amp;H, and I just had to remember Zarf'fall's mergers and acquisitions to myself.

When I have time, I scroll through DragonsTome. I think Bal moved up to Mt. Flake, but he mostly just posts about some decentralized magic to horde treasure that kind of sounds like a scam.

It was late, and I called down to my dragonling that it was time for his friends to go home and to stop playing, I forgot the word, but instead just shouted "Playing Pretend." 

He protested, but it was a school night. Besides, I was taking him treasure hunting next weekend.
