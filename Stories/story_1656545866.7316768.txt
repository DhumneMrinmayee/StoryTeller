*Tick Tock. Tick Tock.*

I heard a story once. The details eluded me, but a lone spaceman was on his ship when he began to hear a constant 'ping' sound somewhere around him. He checked every system, searched every nook and cranny but he could not find the source of the sound or anything wrong with his ship. He was afraid he'd go insane from going months at end hearing the same noise and having nobody else to talk about it. So, instead, he decided he'd fall in love with the noise and accept it until his time to return to Earth came.

*Tick Tick Tick Tock Tick Tick Tick Tock.*

I should thank my subconscious for reminding me of that story. The first few days in this eternal monstruosity of a dollhouse were absolute hell not because of how endless it was, but because of the nigh incessant sounds of clockwork. It haunted me wherever I went, it kept me from sleeping, it scared and confused me the first time the clicking and scratching intensified as clockwork gears moved the room I was in to a different part of this eternal house. Hunger and thirst were seemingly not a problem, but the sound would drive me mad, and I knew it.

*Tock. Tick Tock. Tock. Tick Tock.*

So I learned to embrace it.

*Tick. Tick. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tock.*

I timed my breathing to the orderly clicking and clacking of the house. I'd keep moving when the noise was loudest, and when I found a place where the sounds were quietest I'd take it as the place to sleep. When the sounds intensified indicating the room I was in was about to shift I simply sat down and accepted it as a moment to rest as the gear moved me. The clockwork helped me. They aided me. I embraced it's presence.

*Tock. Tock. Tock.*

I came to hate the plastic house and hate everything about it. I hated the fake furniture, I hated the sinks that did not give me water. I hated the refrigerator that was as lukewarm as the rest of the furniture and the plastic food boxes taunting me within them. I hated the plastic beds with their rigid plastic bed dressing that actually made them even more uncomfortable to sleep in than if they had nothing. 

*Tick. Tick Tick Tock. Tick. Tick Tick Tock.*

I could not see the sky: there were no openings. Windows only showed the inside of other rooms, the occasional skylight only revealed a strange yellow-brown ceiling. Light seemingly came from everywhere, my shadows diluted and unfocused.

*Tock Tock Tick. Tock Tock Tick.*

In the brief moments when the rooms moved however I could see the clockwork beneath the house. Enormous gears. Tiny levers. Springs and handles. Always moving in time with the clicks and clacks around me like magic.

*Tock. Tock Tick. Tick. Tick Tock. Tock. Tock Tick. Tick. Tick Tock.*

The gears have begun to click faster. I move to the edge of the room I am in, holding myself steady with one hand on the doorframe. I knew what was about to happen.

*Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tick Tock. Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tick Tock.*

The six rooms ahead of me will move to the sides: two to the right, one to the left, one to the right, two to the left. For a brief moment I will be able to see the the enormous clockworks beneath me.

*Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tock Tick. Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tock Tick.*

Then the room will move forward. A slow, constant pace. Like a perfectly well-oiled machine. Which it was.

*Tock tick tick. Tock tick tick. Tock tick tick. Tock tick tick. Tock tick tick. Tock tick tick.*

I could not wander these rooms forever. I lost all sense of direction. When I thought I was making good progress the rooms would move and I would be lost again. The plastic dollhouse was chaotic, hellish, fake.

*Tick Tock Tick Tick. Tick Tock Tick Tick. Tick Tock Tick Tick. Tick Tock Tick Tick. Tick Tock Tick Tick.*

The clockwork was real. It was realer than the house. It was more honest with me. It told me what it was going to do. Just as it did just now, as the rooms ahead of me began to move. Two to the right. One to the left. One to the right. Two to the left.

*Tick Tock Tick Tock Tock Tock. Tick Tock Tick Tock Tock Tock. Tick Tock Tick Tock Tock Tock. Tick Tock Tick Tock Tock Tock.*

The room I stood in began to move as soon as the others stopped. I looked below. I know it is dangerous, but I think I could do it. It was better odds than the endless, hellish plastic rooms that were pretending to be something they were not.

*Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock.*

I saw my opening: a flat, horizontal gear. I knew it would be there: the clockwork told me with it's specific ticking. I waited calmly as the room moved forward, then took a single determined step forward towards the gear below. It would lead me to another path.

*Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tock. Tick Tock. Tick Tick Tock.*

And worst comes to worst, I have made my peace.

*Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.*

I always loved clock towers. They are weirdly soothing for me.
