You were confused. Bewildered. Who was this journalist anyway?! Every team you sent to ‘do the work’ to put simply, kept disappearing off your radar. Which prompted the question, ‘Who the heck is this guy and how does he keep escaping!?’
You, in your whole career, never had seen this happen. And you were going to get to the bottom of this.

“Look,” you speak up to your partner in this mission, hands rubbing your temples as you thought to yourself, “Jace, look up the journalists file again, Clark Kent, if you will. Read it out to me… again.”

“Seriously Deliah? We’ve done this about what, a billion times?” He replies with a heavy and annoyed sigh.

“Well, Jace, we have to get at least somewhere! This whole case is just confusing! And basically impossible!” You spoke back, frustrated, and close to yelling, “Every team we send, just disappears! We have to get to the bottom of this!”

“I know Del, but fuming over it doesn’t help,  give some time to recollect, think of some other things, maybe look for more information about the guy,” Jace advises, patting your shoulder.

You take your partner’s suggestion and breathe slowly a few times, calming yourself down, “Right, sorry for acting out. It’s just annoying ya know? Every team we send out just… it helps nothing. No intel, information, nor success.”

“Yeah, I understand Del,” he says, “And we’ll get to the bottom of this, I promise. Now, I’m going out to my smoke break right now.”

“Alright,” you nod, “We’ll get to the bottom of this.”
