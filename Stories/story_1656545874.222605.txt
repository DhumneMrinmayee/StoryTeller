Going in knowing this will be a tough missions, you put priority on gathering intel. You start to notice odd trends. For instance, the tail always loses him during emergencies.

During a boring watch your partner jokingly says, “it’s almost like he is a magnet for Superman, everywhere he goes something bad seems to follow.”

In a daze you ask him to repeat what he said. He repeats, “as often as our bro and Superman are in the same location, you would think the two would know each other.”

Then it hits you like a train. Maybe they do know each other. You start looking through pictures to see if they are ever both in the same image at the same time. You notice that Clark Kent or Superman can only be seen at one time. You ask your self not believing it, “could Clark Kent be the same person as Superman?”

Your partner starts cracking up and looks at you. “What are you smoking man?” He blurts out.

You turnover the tail to the next team and head home that night questioning your sanity. As you fall asleep you hear the window of you 10th story apartment squeak open to see Superman fly through. He looks at you and asks if you are going to drop the tail, or if he is going to have to drop you.
