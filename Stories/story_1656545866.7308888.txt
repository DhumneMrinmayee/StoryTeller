*My fucking head!*

Damn that hurts. Like I got hit by a truck. What even happened? Last I remember I was walking home and then... I think I tripped? I... *where the hell am I*?

I took a look around and see... what *is* this place? How did I get here? It's like a dollhouse, only human-sized. And this noise, it's like endless ticking, clicking, it's... gears?

I got up from the floor where I lay and inspected my surroundings more carefully. Ugly pastel-pink walls, carpet that grinds against the skin, plastic furniture, not a soul to be seen. I felt my blood pumping faster and faster as the utter strangeness of this situation set in. I did the obvious thing first - I pinched myself to see if I was asleep. I was not. Panic was setting in but I resolved myself not to despair just yet. Taking a deep breath of the stale, dusty air, I set off to explore this place.

Room after room I walked only to find the exact same layout of furniture, lighting and wallpaper. Disturbingly so, however, all little imperfections were also perfectly lined up; small tears on the wallpaper here, loose thread there, but I know I wasn't walking in circles. I started dropping change in rooms I already visited and it wasn't in the new ones, but walking back, I could find the coins where I left them.

I walked to the next room, hoping for something new, and found it; only not something I had hoped for. It was a doll - one of those old-fashioned ones, but oddly large, almost as big as me. Made of porcelain and with seemingly real hair, it set its never-blinking eyes at me and started waving its hand, back and forth, back and forth, audible clicking emanating out of it with every motion. The damn clicking in this entire place *never stopped*.

After carefully examining the doll and finding it useless, I kept walking. Room after room. I felt like I was going for hours and was starting to wonder why I wasn't getting exhausted, or hungry, or thirsty, but-

*Tick.*

A noise louder than the most startled me; I turned around to face it. It was a... mannequin. Faceless, featureless, entirely white with some sort of black paint or liquid around its joints.

*Tock.*

Its leg moved as it clicked with speed beyond what I thought possible. It was as if, when a gear turned, it simply changed position without *actually* moving.

*Tick.*

Another foot moved. Forward. Towards me.

*Tock.*

The entire thing was suddenly a good meter closer to me. I started to run.

*Tick.*

I cast a quick glance behind me and saw it ever closer.

*Tock.*

It's closer! Keep running, *keep running!*

***Tick.***

I looke-

*My fucking head!*

Vision returned to me and I looked around. Shit. Still in this place. But this time I- I saw someone walking. A person, a regular person! They look as lost as I do. I tried calling out but... couldn't. My throat felt hoarse like it never did before.

They walked right up to me and started looking at me. Do something! I tried to grab them but couldn't move my arm. But... wait, I was moving my arm, not of my volition. Back and forth. I was waving, an audible click of a gear accompanying every motion. I tried blinking to signal my distress but I- I-

***I- why can't I blink?***
