The ancient looking glass beer bottle I found on the coast of Ireland was supposed to be a display piece. The rainbow rust pattern on the cap, the wooden handle on the neck that had survived the waves, the rocks and the sea creatures made it one of a kind according to online experts. Suffice it to say I wasn't keen to clean it up and make it look modern or mundane.  But good old Bull, my Tibetan Mastiff found a way to knock it off the high shelf, without destroying it and drool all over it and apparently summoned a Genie. "Greetings, master of my master". Bull clearly delighted with the commotion barked loudly,  in response the genie sighed and snapped his fingers, "Why did I learn Dog as a 4th language?" The mythical wish granter moaned before a plume of blue smoke rose from the ground enveloped me and knocked me out. I came to on the ground seemingly on my hands and knees to the sight of Bull staring at me concerned, when I realized I couldn't feel my hands and feet. I tried to stand but immediately fell over backwards and saw furry dog paws instead my hands. "Arooooooo" I howled rather than screaming a curse word. Was this really happening?!?!?...had my dog , my best buddy used a wish to transform me. "In response Bull barked repeatedly...but instead of a woof....I heard laughter and.... another voice. "Ohh boy oh boy, this is great Dave...we can truly be buddies now, but please do not cuss it hurts my feelings." I could understand Bull it seemed...maybe this wouldn't be THAT BAD, I thought. Until I noticed the genie filing his nails in the corner. 'ohh Hell, Bull has two more wishes.' I thought to myself before Bull pounced on me like a goofy lovable oaf and started licking me.
