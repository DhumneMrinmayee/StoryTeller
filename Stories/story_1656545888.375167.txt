Definitely good at untying.

Aren’t opposable thumbs just the best?

Plus! cats have us down from way back when in Egypt for scritches - on demand (!) and (occasional) door opening… and then changing their mind and walking away having reconsidered the entire idea AFTER getting the human-servant out of the chair. 

And yes… the other sentient beings definitely find the opposable thumbs useful for the untying tasks.

Mind you… having observed the cats… 

….some of them have discussed that the cats might actually not have such a terrible relationship with the tall ugly hairless untying creatures and it could actually really help to do some more investigation. 

Investigation that *could* involve belly rubs and high pitched affirmations of body positivity.

I mean …

Humans were weird and ugly and high pitched but *definitely* good at untying stuff.

And scritches. 

Pats too. 

Possibly belly rubs … but the data isn’t in yet. 

Additional sentient volunteers to work with the humans will be needed. 

Note: Volunteering sign-up will be limited to only an hour to prevent a repeat of the server meltdown that occurred during the last volunteer nomination window.
