You tell everyone that you have the power of flight. But that seems like too simple of an explanation, and people are starting to get suspicious. 

It is incredibly hard to explain that there happens to be a very unique “phenomenon” that occurs within your body. It is something completely natural within your body, and no one else’s. 

But the truth is, you’re just incredibly flatulent. Not only that, but instead of methane, your body naturally produces helium instead. And you’ve learned that if you prevent yourself from passing gas for long enough, and retain enough flatulence, you can make yourself float. When you do finally let loose, the sheer amount you have inside of you propels you incredible distances at incredible speeds, while the residual helium keeps you afloat until your “tank” runs empty. 

One of the awkward questions you frequently receive is “why does it take you so long to get in the air?”. Which is usually followed by “why does it sound like you’re releasing a balloon when you finally get going? A balloon full of sewage?”

You want to answer honestly. You want to tell someone, anyone the truth about what goes on inside you. But you fear the response you might get. Either utter disbelief, or absolute hysterics. You aren’t sure which would be worse, so for now you just keep telling everyone “my superhero ability is “flight””.
