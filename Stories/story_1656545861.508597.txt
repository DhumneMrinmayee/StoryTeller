The world had come to a standstill. The news said a meteor was coming. Astrologists world-wide agreed that this would be catastrophic and completely unavoidable. We had only a matter of days to sort our things before the end of things. As expected, the world fell into mass pandemonium, anarchy at its worst. No law and no morals. In the chaos, two groups formed: those who wanted to spend their last days with their loved ones and those who embraced the worst of their vices and let them run free.

Governments were nonexistent and soon the only law was brute force and only the feared had strength. Kill or be killed. The only way to stay out of it was to quarantine yourself from the outside world. Fortunately, most had enough to survive the week, but others weren't so lucky. It was the first worldwide purge and suddenly the meteor became a consolation and hope for most. This was worse than death.

Hours to the big event, there was mass prayers. Everyone suddenly found God and prayed for whatever they believed in. When the meteor passed by Earth, instead of immediate death, they found they had to deal with consequences. Governments were overthrown and new leaders were elected. The state of society could not be reversed, so every country chose to honor the dead and prosecute all who'd been active participants in the purge. The number was so high, that eventually, a mass pardon was passed and the world came back to order. Since then, every year, a full week is committed to remembering the atrocities of that time and every participant is incarcerated for that week. Nowhere close to justice, but better than nothing.
