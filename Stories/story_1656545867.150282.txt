You fucked up.

You took 30 years of my life, in essence, by erasing those memories and *still you fucked up*. Because you *missed* a few spots. I don't know what rookie memorymancer the Bureau employed for my case, but whoever it was, they deserve to get fired. 

Look, if you take decades of someone's life for a crime they did, that's fine. I accept that. I don't know what I did, but I accept my punishment. But if you miss a spot here and there? It drives you mad. It is so, *so* much worse than not having memory because of the relapses, the hallucinations, the nightmares. I see it, in my dreams, the torn pieces of what I have done. The blood on my hands, the piles of money I know not from where they came, the... the...

Well. Let's not dwell on the details.

Not too long ago I witnessed an accident. Biker got hit by a car. Seeing the biker on the road, bloody and broken, it... reminded me. Like a blast from the past, I felt myself again, for just a moment. 

I'm sick of not knowing what's real. I'm tired of not getting a good night's sleep. I can only take a bitter pleasure from the irony of what you've forced me to do to gain the slightest semblance of peace.

*Everything*.

I will steal. I will destroy. I will *kill*. I will rain chaos down on this place. I will do anything and everything until I know what feels familiar and then I'll be able to know what it is exactly I've done. I already know just how familiar the weight of a knife feels, how used I seem to be to holding a gun. Just know this.

You've brought this on yourself.
