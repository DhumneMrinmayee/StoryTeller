“We only want to engage trade with neighboring villages. We believe it can be beneficial socially and finically.” 

He hesitated. He was aware that we were after their supply of rare ores that goes untouched since their village sees it as more of a “alter of god”. But their situation worsens as the village was hit with a plague that withered their crops. They had no money or food, thus the opportune moment to gain from their weakness without spilling blood.

Papers were signed and trade with the village was accepted. It was only the beginning for my takeover of the country without spending a human soul.
