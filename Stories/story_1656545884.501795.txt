The effort to retrieve the object had been significant. When we'd first spotted it travelling through space, it was clearly aimed, vaguely, at Jupiter or Earth; but would miss Jupiter by tens of thousands of miles and pass within the moon's orbit; practically next door, in spatial terms. The object was clearly inhuman, and transmitting a radio signal that we couldn't decipher. When a joint US-China team took the object aboard, it was carefully placed in a sealed lead 'Coffin' for protective purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, it looked like any other meteorite; a rough rock... but with a single visible, obviously artificial corner emerging from the side. An up-close scan; instruments had been built into the coffin prior to launch for exactly that reason; revealed a dodecahedron shape, with some form of deposits coating the outside in a seemingly random fashion; mostly iron and carbon.

&amp;#x200B;

The scans determined that the object contained something else; some sophisticated bit of machinery, likely the source of the radio signal. Out of paranoia about the dangers of its contents, a new space station was built surrounding the craft before the object was opened; purely by machines, with any machines removed from the coffin melted down and launched on a trajectory for the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

The only things allowed back on earth were the astronauts themselves; and that only after a thorough scan both of the men and women involved, and of the coffin to ensure a proper seal had been maintained. Unfortunately, the translation wasn't complete until after this had happened; everything might have turned out differently otherwise.

"Thank you for saving our species. Your sacrifice will be honored for eternity." The core message at the heart of a long string of mathematical strings, images, and language tutorials.  The most glaring part of it all was the strict instructions to place the object on an uninhabited world a certain distance from the sun, dependant on the relative size of said sun, and the warning that whoever placed the object in such fashion would, in all liklihood, be killed by the object itself. Followed by a request to leave certain raw materials at the landing site, and that, once they began to awaken, they would like information about whatever brave souls had sacrificed themselves to give their race a second chance. It also noted that the object had been launched at a particular appropriate body; Enceladus; but that the ability to aim a trajectory from sixty light-years away was unlikely due to the chance of random interference of stellar debris. If the object happened to look as if it were going to hit Enceladus on its own, it could be left alone; it would handle things on its own from there.

Soon, the exact meanings became clear. In Beijing and in Arizona, it started. The spread in Arizona was contained; a mostly small-scale affair, centered on the home of a returning astronaut, a dome was built around it, and inside the astronaut, the plants, the animals; and the unfortunate man and his family; could all be seen dying, to be slowly replaced by a vivid obsidian-colored alien biosphere. The man's house had no outside water lines; as it turned out, if this home had been the only breakout, it could have been contained indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

Beijing, however, was a different matter, and ultimately made the efforts in Arizona pointless. On live television, a reporter, visibly sweating drops of black fluid, was trying to pretend everything had been contained, and there was no danger outside of Beijing city limits; even as an alien micro-organism repurposed all the water in his body, leaving a dessicated husk of a man lying in front of the camera as the transmission continued; as it would continue, until the power ultimately failed.

&amp;#x200B;

For the remnant of humanity, living in their bunkers and isolation domes, the following weeks are a matter of historical record. Once the organism reached the water table, that was the end. It traveled through the septic systems, water filtration, and into the ocean; and where it went, the sea levels dropped, the air became steadily more oxygen-enriched; and the world became covered with endless forests of blue-black life, mostly in the form of long, harmless tendrils.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, none of it seemed to have a purpose; there were no obvious animals or intelligent creatures. It was only weeks later, when the improvised space station crashed in what had once been the Sahara, that things truly took off. Once it came into contact with the newly formed biosphere, the alien object somehow induced pods to form; at first, smaller alien life-forms. Creatures with odd, trilateral symmetry; three legs, three eyes, three wings.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the first sentient aliens formed; apparently revived versions of the final members of their species. They almost immediately began work on two primary projects; saving what was left of humanity, and rebuilding their own civilization. Incredibly, there were over ten million human survivors, and while humanity would take centuries to once more reach the numbers they once had, for the first few years after the Event, the greatest problem humanity faced, all these scattered survivalists, doctors, soldiers, and politicians who had survived in their sealed bunkers, was communications issues due to their own wildly different nations of origin.

&amp;#x200B;

The remnant of humanity now thrives, and is working with a blend of its own and alien technology to climb into the stars; and build a new world for itself, to replace the one it accidentally gave away.
