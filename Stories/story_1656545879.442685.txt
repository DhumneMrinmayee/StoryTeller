Well well well the fey spirit thought to itself.  This was a gross violation of norms.  She mulled it over on her throne.  It would be that blasted law, as a marquess, she couldn't change it either.  If she abandoned it it would be the end of her reign.  Yet still, it would be unfair.

She mulled it over again.  The law required her to curse the child, yet the boy had done nothing wrong.  It was practically a newborn.  But still, the parents had to be punished.  There!  If the child were cursed to bring down something the king cared about.  She whistled for her carriage pulled by feathered theropods and rode to the castle.  

There, she climbed onto the cieling, hanging upon the rafters that supported the beautiful vaulting over the room where the ceremony took place.  There was a stage and they proclaimed the child's name: Waldemar.

At that point, the fey marquess lllept down and landed on the stage and said,

"Who forgot to invite me?  Anyhow, unfortunately for you this means I have to curse this little one"

The crowd gasped,

"I know, it's unfair, this little one hasn't done anything wrong.  Take your problems up with the queen of the fey.  I don't make the rules.  Anyway."

Now it was time to deliver the actual curse,

"Before Waldemar begins his reign, he will lead many armies to defeat.  This will nearly cause the kingdom to come to ruin—mind you—It will come to ruin"

The king interupted, "Why must you do this?"

"I'm not finished" the marquess replied, offended, "However, once Waldemar takes the throne, he will usher in a new golden age of this land and be known as Waldemar the redeamer.  His earlier failures will be completely overshadowed, and the failures will in the end be attributed to our king here."

The marquess smiled at the king whose jaw had just dropped with the spead of a bullet train, and then strutted out.
