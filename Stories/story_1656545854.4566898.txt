This is a prequel to Part 1.

&amp;#x200B;

As agreed upon, I met my new roommate in the backyard of the house we were both renting rooms in. At first, it was all normal. I had to establish dominance, so I mentioned that I'm working towards my PhD. The asshole didn't take that well. His name is Richard, and he hates me, I can already tell. Oh, and, according to what he just said, he's a vampire.

"Why aren't you scared?" Richard shouts. His Russian accent makes him sound enormously intimidating when he shouts. "I'm a vampire--I could kill you!"

I heft my invisible shotgun so that Richard can see I'm holding it, and I hope it intimidates him back. Trying to play it cool, I say: "So could literally every other human. You're not special."

"Oh yeah?" Richard sneers. "If I'm so normal, how did I get the name Richard and *still* be born in Russia?"

*Shit.* He's called my bluff. The problem is, Richard's right. He *is* special. Normal people don't have talons that can rip through steel and abs that can deflect bullets. Seriously, fuck Twilight for making vampires so fit and hot.

Looks like this situation is going to turn violent. Luckily, I come prepared for such emergencies. I'm a vampire hunter, and this is my trade.

"I don't know how you got the name," I say, and pull my wormhole grappling hook from my belt. "But I know you're not going to have it for much longer."

In a flash, the fight commences. He lunges toward me and I fling the grappling hook straight at his face. I wait until it's right in front of him to activate the wormhole, and the fool lunges straight through the portal. I mentally place the other portal above the first, and facing down, so Richard's lunge turns into a faceplant as he falls to the ground.

I level my shotgun--loaded with garlic shells--and fire, once, but Richard, in a flash, has already leapt away from the spot, and as I readjust my aim I only have time to see him streaking straight for me before his talons slice through my shirt and dig into my shoulder. I grimace but give some of it back to Richard when I slam the butt of my shotgun into his nose.

He goes staggering back and the combat ceases for a moment. We watch each other warily. I have one more round in my shotgun. It's gonna have to count.

"Wait," Richard says. "Wait. If you kill me, your rent will increase by one hundred percent. Can you really afford me dead?"

I stop and think about that for a moment. He's right. I can't. "Well, uh, same to you, buddy, but, like, vice versa."

A look of pure horror comes over Richard's face. I imagine it's more or less the same look I've got on mine.

*Fuck.*
