   It had been weeks since the moment that Frederick’s life had changed irreversibly. Weeks since he had felt the light of Solaris. Weeks since he discovered that his life was no longer life. Frederick, the one mighty Paladin of the order of the Breaking Dawn, had been reduced to nothing more than a filthy undead creature. His very existence now blasphemed the God he had given everything to serve.  
  
   Now raised as a revenant, the former Paladin seethed at this now cruel twist of fate. He had been stolen from the warm embrace of his God and twisted him into an evil abomination. He tried to use this righteous anger to break the bonds that held him to this mortal plane and allow himself to pass into the afterlife.  
  
   Frederick remained powerless and cursed the name of the necromancer that had imprisoned him inside of his own body. A being dark enough to bind and corrupt the very body of a holy paladin and cause their own God to abandon them.   
  
   Frederick wondered if this was his punishment for failing to kill the evil spellcaster. If his way to redemption was to break the unnatural command this being had over him and finish what he had started. He couldn’t let his legacy be tarnished by allowing anyone to know his final humiliation as an undead.  
  
The Order of the Breaking Dawn had grossly underestimated the young prodigy. Three paladins, 2 knights, and nearly a dozen guards were lost in the attack on his foe’s village. He was able to animate the corpses of the dead while the battle raged on with little effort. He seemed to wield the dark arts unlike any he had seen before.  
  
Frederick tried to shake the feeling of fear that had started to grow within him. He knew this was his burden to bear. His God had turned their back on him, but he would earn their admiration once more. His loyalty would remain unwavering in the face of eternal darkness. Frederick needed to overcome for the sake of the world.
