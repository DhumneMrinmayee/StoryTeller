"Hey babe, I saw this thing on Twitter about the uncanny Valley.  There must be some evolutionary reason why we are scared of things that look human but aren't quite human. Isn't that freaky!?" I said

"No, I mean it's probably just some defense mechanism agaisnt disease or something. Same reason why looking at a dead body is creepy and the more decayed it is the more off putting it is.  We are wired to detect small things that indicate mental or physical disease and when our brain classifies something as human it expects certain things. If whatever we are looking at doesn't show those things then it fires a red flag.  It seems like a pretty reasonable defense mechanism, nothing weird about it"  my wife said

"Oh yeah, that makes sense" I said
