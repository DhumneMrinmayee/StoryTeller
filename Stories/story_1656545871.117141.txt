The angels never understood my decision. Never truly tried. They had their views and what they believed in, and as such followed it.

It took little convincing in the end. I simply had to be mildly insistent. Three times, I confirmed it. Then it was made so.

The other lords laughed at first. What could a human know of punishment and suffering? How could a Human possibly rule with authority over the chaotic Demon-kind?

It took only three days to quell their ridiculing voices. After three weeks I was asked by the most curious of them what I had done to so thoroughly break my former kinsmen.

It was asked with a respectful and mildly horrified expression.

I admit it, I laughed. They just couldn’t understand. It was so simple. It always has been.

My entire existence, I had always followed one simple rule, and it allowed me to act with absolute certainty. It enabled my compassion, my sincerity, and my honor.

It was this same rule, that had always brought me pain. Those dark moments of anguish. The raw raking chasms it would create.

It was the dark half of this rule that allowed me to know that I had to use it for the good of others. To free them, as I had been. To step out of the darkness and into the light.

I smiled lovingly, as I looked upon my brother, and I answered him.

“I told them the truth.”
