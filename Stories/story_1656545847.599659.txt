“If you don’t turn down the music I swear I’ll open the blinds in here,” I said.

Jack said nothing and continued to look at the screen. He took a swig of blood out of his water bottle and continued to focus on his game. 

“Hey, I said to turn it down. Besides, your country-rap hybrid music sucks more than you do pun intended,” I said. 

“Ok, well if you don’t like it why don’t you go into the other room?” scoffed Jack. 

“I can’t go into the other room because I’m eating right now. Also, I’ve been noticing blood on some of my plates too and I know it’s not from me. Remember what we said about using each other’s plates without permission?”

“I told you, I always purify the blood before eating anyways. It comes off pretty easily. I don't see why you’re so upset,” said Jack.

“What’s upsetting is that you’re spilling the blood of my species and have the audacity to use my dishes for your blood infused meals. I might as well stake you right now,” I said.

What I said must’ve struck a nerve with Jack because he stood straight up and bared his fangs at me.

“You talk a lot of talk for someone who’s killed my fellow vampires in their sleep like it was nothing. I don’t see what’s stopping me from turning you into a deflated balloon,” yelled Jack.

“I’d like to see you try.”

We both yelled at each other. I readied my stake and garlic while Jack grew his bat wings and fangs. As we charged at each other, we both heard a knock on the door.

“Crap, it’s the landlord,” said Jack.

“Yeah, that guy's the real monster. I can’t believe we both have to pay $2000 per person a month to live here. Did you remember the money this time?” I asked.

“Let me grab my checkbook,” said Jack with a sigh.

We both put down our guards and walked to the door miserably. As much as we wanted to kill each other, we simply couldn’t afford it.
