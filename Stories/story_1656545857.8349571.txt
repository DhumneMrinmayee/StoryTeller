“So what does the rank mean?”

The pitch-black cat was unusually chatty. It effortlessly dodged my swipes and leapt through the tree. I seemed to chase its shadow, getting a branch in my face and plummeting to square one repeatedly.

“It means I get prestigious missions and guild perks,” I finally caved in and responded. It'd been pestering me the whole afternoon, but I refused to talk to him out of pride. Or spite. Or maybe because I’d look crazy.

“Right, but I’m talking about *narrative*, darling. What does it add to your story?”

If this pest could talk, maybe it heard a bard outside the nearby tavern tell of my exploits. Slaying dragons, hauling plundered treasure, and other feats that favour strength over agility. 

“Oh. I suppose it sets the crowd’s expectations.”

“But isn’t that the role of the plot? Show, don’t tell, and all that.”

*It should follow its own advice*, I thought. Though that was a sound idea. I approached the base of the tree, and charged up my Dragon-Scale axe.

“I posit that the ranking system’s true purpose is to be violated by ironic twists, making it an unreliable gauge!”

In one swing, I chopped the tree at the trunk. The cat fell out, and I caught him with one hand while producing my Angel-Wing shield in the other. A white aura surrounded us both, leaving us unscathed as the tree fell.

The townspeople nearby, including the farmer who hired me, looked shocked. I held up the cat and gave a big smile, and they seemed to figure it out. A few cheered, but most went back about their business.

The cat meowed performatively to them, before whispering to me, 

“Thank you valiant hero, for proving my point.”
