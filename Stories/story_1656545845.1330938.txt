In an instant it all fell into place in my head. Sister had told me earlier that there was an unmistakable stench of death in the air. It had me perplexed as if it was the death of “our king” that she sensed with such glee, I surely would have felt it as well. But as is known, a person is rarely able to detect his own scent, even if he reeked of death for everyone in the room to know.  


In this moment there was no smell in the air, no sound, and no colors of any kind for me to feel. Nothing to keep me aware of the moment I was living as a dead person. There was but a constant stream of air filling my lungs that would soon be worth approximately 3 schillings if sold, accompanied by my beating heart which made me think of home. Of how I have spent my years scared and scarred. Then just when I took initiative, tried to make my mark, I failed to see that the mark was to be made with streams of my own blood. It is as if from birth something around me had been waiting to end my existence in the most ironic way imaginable and nothing less would satisfy its petty needs.   


You would think, dear omnipotent presence around me, that I would have questions or even  snarky remarks to you after all this time and all this heartbreak. But no, all I have to say to you is this; you may break this shell of flesh, but my soul is not mine to give for I never possessed one to begin with. How am I certain of this, you ask?  Well, you see if I had a soul all these fifteen misery-ridden years, I never would have made it this far.  


Now my mind wanders not to my place of birth but the place of my upbringing, the orphanage. It is all coming back to me, the sinking feeling, uneasy breathing, approaching sister, impending darkness and the words whispered in my ear; ”Lights out.”
