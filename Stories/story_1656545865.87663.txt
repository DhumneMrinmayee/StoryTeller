Over time, her visits gave me a calming sense of routine and regularity. I subconsciously and intuitively started to anticipate her arrival.

A day or two before I knew she will come, I would prepare topics for discussion. That way, our interactions stopped being shallow and started to gain depth. After a couple of years we were able to talk about anything: our lives, family, friends, etc.

During our conversations, I was often amazed by the wisdom she had. A number of times, she would inspire me to find solutions to my problems, be a better person, improve my life and my relationship with others, etc.

One full moon, everything changed. She did not come to see me. 

I started to feel really agitated, repeatedly checking the moon and the time. She would still not come.

I barely slept that night. Something inside me told me I was not going to ever see her again. 

In the morning, I knew exactly what I had to do: I gained the courage to buy a bouquet of flowers and was determined to put a happy end to our story.

As I approached the cemetery, I read the sentence that I very painfully had to write exactly 10 years ago: "To my beloved daughter, who died in a tragic accident in 2012".

Carefully laying the flowers on her grave, I said "Thanks for your company all these years. You can now fly free wherever you are".
