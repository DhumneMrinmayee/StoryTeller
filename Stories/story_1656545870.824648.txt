It had been a few weeks since the egg hatched and now everyone in the village was looking at me differently. They used to treat me like any other farmer, but now they were scared of me. They would cross the street to avoid me, or worse, they would bow down to me.



I didn't know how to make them understand that I was still just like them. A regular farmer trying to make a living. I was not a god nor a demon.



It all started when one of my eggs hatched and revealed a fire-breathing dragon.



After the dragon was born, my farm was overrun with people. They were there to see the dragon, and me, the one who raised it. But I hadn’t raised it on purpose. I just wanted to be left alone to live my life, but the people from the village and from the city wouldn’t leave me alone. They either wanted to worship me or kill me.



I had to keep the dragon locked up so that it wouldn’t accidentally kill anyone. I didn’t want anyone to die just because they were curious about my dragon.



The attention surrounding me was very uncomfortable, but at least I had my dragon to keep me company on my farm. I had to keep a close eye on it, though, because it was always trying to escape.



The first thing I did after the dragon hatched was to build a fence around the chicken coop so that it wouldn’t eat any more chickens. The second thing I did was to build a fence around the house so that it wouldn’t eat me or my family.



...



It was a rainy day. The clouds were low, and dark and foreboding. The wind howled loudly through the branches of the trees. Huge raindrops fell from the sky and created puddles in the yard.



I was in the house, thinking about work when I heard a loud rumbling sound. It almost sounded like thunder. But it wasn’t thunder. It was a dragon’s roar.



I ran to the window and saw my own dragon walking around in the yard. It was looking at the sky.



I heard another roar and the dragon turned its head to look. This time, I looked with it. I saw a huge, enormous, terrifying dragon. It was dark and had a dark red color. It looked like a real, live monster.



It landed on the ground with a heavy thud. It was huge. It had a long neck and tail, sharp horns and claws, and it was breathing fire.



The dragon I had kept in my chicken coop was only about a quarter the size of the red dragon. I had never seen anything like this dragon before. It was so much bigger than my dragon. It was terrifying. I could see the fire from its mouth as it breathed.



It roared at my dragon and my dragon roared back. The two dragons were in front of each other, just staring and breathing fire.



I heard a knock on my door and I reluctantly walked to the door. I slowly opened it and saw an old man dressed in a long, brown robe standing on my doorstep.



“I’m sorry to bother you,” he said with a gentle smile, “but I heard about your dragon and I wanted to come see it. My name is Master Pi Ang and I am here to help you.”
