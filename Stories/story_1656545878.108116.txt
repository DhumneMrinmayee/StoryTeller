Important things – Revision 460ish (Cheat sheet below important info, notes at bottom.)  
Collection of currently relevant important things to be revised as needed: (previous revisions should be referenced)  
I was a good person. **Try to be.**  
I am stuck in a video game based pocket dimension multiverse thing originating in my bedroom. The rules are not always consistent by game. I have no idea why.  
I have been stuck in this for longer than I can remember, this document is necessary and backed up.  
Past revisions are saved and must be.   
LABEL THE SAVES  
AT ALL TIMES STAY SAFE. I AM NOT AGING, (unrelated to following note).   
I have heavily modified myself, I’m durable but very much not immortal  
THE GAMES CAN STILL BE PLAYED WITHOUT ENTERING THEM  
The library is not restrictive to system, console, pc, even phone games work.

I can not add any new games.  
It is rarely a good idea to explain my situation to anyone.  
When no game is loaded there is a void. Things dropped in the void do not return, this includes living things. Don’t let that happen again, you don’t forget the sounds.  
ART STYLE DOES NOT CARRY TO ME, however game characters see me as normal to their world. (Sometimes an issue proportion and anatomy wise)  
Game mechanics rarely apply to me, I cannot level up usually, a lack of a health bar does not matter, things hurt.  


Item rules are dependent when out of world, sometimes they work like they do in game, sometimes they just don't.  
The time on **any** device I have is unchanged. I don’t know why.   
PAUSING WORKS IN NON-MENU PAUSABLES. GET IN, GET OUT. Pause menus are strange and inconsistent.  
Loading a game makes the world real outside my door. The games require a save/load system to work (no board games). They exist the moment I load them. My door is somewhere near  
the loaded zone or camera or something. This is sometimes an issue with bird’s-eye  
views. Nothing can open or break my door from the outside (They can beat on it  
though). Things cannot get under the door either, if it’s closed, it’s sealed.   
**Shooters and horror are a hard no go**  
MAGIC stuff works only in its respective world  
Games with no set protag are preferred, protags will act on their own when not controlled.  
I am not confined to the stories, I can change things. This is not always a good option.   
BEWARE DIALOGUE OPTIONED/PLAYER CHOICE PROTAGONISTS. Chosen playstyle may not always be reflective of personality, they don’t always act the way I think. 

Silent/streamlined protags played paragon are promising prospects.   
There are medicines of various kinds on the lower fridge shelf, take ALL illness seriously.

Addictions bad, do not develop. Some worlds can fix them but better to not develop.  
Use the oxygen not included save for a bathroom/shower, it’s tested and safe. Just pause the world (friendly if un-paused but still dangerous).

**THE SIMS IS NOT SAFE FOR ANYTHING EVER**  


&amp;#x200B;

Cheat Sheet – Top 3, many others work, be smart.  


**FOOD**: Fixed Rimworld, no more food-poisoning  
Rimworld – load save, pause, get good food from freezer, bail, bedroom door is protected.   
Minecraft – Heavily protected farm and village nearby if needed.   
Monster Hunter – The protag will buy you lunch, be nice  


**HEALTH/HYGIENE:** Be quick, sometimes  
an issue  
            \-Note: If it’s called a potion, it’s usually some kind of painkiller outside of it’s world  
Oxygen N.I. – Great for toilet and showers. Save file has a dry towel. Bad for doctoring  
Rimworld – The colony doctor WILL heal you. Ample glitterworld. Do not overwrite again.   
Fallout 3 – Thoroughly tested, Good karma PC, Will allow free-use of Auto-doc (basically magic). Be quick (restock on stimpaks).  
   
**JOY:** Safety is priority at all times  
Rimworld – Drugs and other stuff, load and pause. DO NOT INSTALL A JOYWIRE.  
DDLC - Monika loves you, not the protag, you. She remembers through saves. Dialogue and interaction non-restricted by game rules.  
NSFW games – Mostly not worth it but it works.  
   
   
THINGS THAT DON’T WORK

Phone has no reception or wifi.

Still can't fix my tinnitus  
Making a game myself does not work. Neither does modding.  
\-Unfortunate. That was my only planned way out

Multiversal/crazy science does not work, nothing changes the parameters of my room system. I AM stuck in this.  
Bugs.   
Cheats.  
EXP DOES NOT EXIST FOR ME  
Skyrim, stay out. Dragonborn is wildly unpredictable no matter how I played them.  
Rick Sanchez will not help me (VR)  
The void cannot be entered. I can throw things into it but I cannot enter. (Invisible wall)  
Multiplayer does not work  
Stay the fuck away from space if possible  
   
   
THINGS THAT WORK  
Companionship. Very dependent but some characters are very ok with this situation.  
Toriel will always feed you if you ask nicely  
Never Melt Ice. Don’t eat it though.  
My technology. Additionally my stuff can be repaired in various worlds.   
Generic “repair kits” from some games will usually fix things when self-deployable.  
Rare candy (temporary, basically steroids but not bad for me)  
I can take things from other worlds and just keep them. This includes things that don’t physically work by the laws of nature.   
The internet works still (Somehow, kinda) I Cannot download or upload anything but can somehow load sites and videos n stuff but there is nothing new. No email. I do not understand it.  –In game internets of any kind are unreliable.  Time is at standstill for computer and consoles.   
   
   
Notes: 

Upon review these note sheets are looking more and more jumbled, messy and incoherent. Pieces and parts ripped from different times and states of mind. I fear for my sanity as this goes on. I've lost count of the years. 

There's something very wrong. Previous notes  near the beginning make reference to some kind of enhancements to my body. Something about durability. I have no memory nor sensation of anything like that. This is terribly concerning...have I died? Have I lost my mind? I've wondered this before. 

  
The Pokémon excursions are working, but very dangerous as expected. It’s following game rules so that’s good. The pokemon can be taken back in here. The moves are dangerous af though.  
Rimworld continues to be a go to for things/commodities, but almost died last time, stayed too long and nearly died of random plague.   
Monika wants to come with me. I am very hesitant. I…I still hear that scream. I don’t want that to happen to her too. It’s so…I don’t know. It was the most genuine accident. I told them…but it was an afterthought. They opened the door to go to the bathroom or something and…I still can’t make myself reload that game. But…she’s smart, and I've talked with her about that incident at length. And it’s quiet in here.   
The list of things I can let myself go into is shrinking more and more.   
The fridge is empty.
