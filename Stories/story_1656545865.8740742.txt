Their ritual always begins without much ado.

A knock at the door. Once, twice, rarely thrice. Nolan has grown to anticipate her the way one expects a bite when placed between a waiting set of jaws.

She hasn't changed much over the yearsâ€”which is, of course, a nice way of saying that she hasn't changed at all. But it gives Nolan some sense of sanity to try and find little things about her that might have changed, so he looks anyway. A band-aid on her forearm. A new piercing in her ear. The few changes she makes hardly matter at all though, because if it weren't for the hickory-brown skin and bone-white hair pulled back into buns, she would look like she just stepped out of a strip mall from 1986. Which doesn't make much sense, given the fact that Nolan first met her in 2002, but trying to make sense of Mona has resulted in little more than headaches.

"Hello, Nolan."

"Hello, Mona."

"Do you have any sweets?"

"There's a cake waiting on the table."

They spend the first couple of minutes eating in silence. Mona doesn't take off her jacket (worn denim with pins as far back as 1901, the last time Nolan checked) or slip off her boots (black? Brown? They're so worn that Nolan's never been able to tell), but she does glance up at Nolan over the rim of her wire-framed glasses.

"You look tired."

"I'm always tired."

"You should sleep more."

A roll of the eyes. "I can sleep when I'm dead."

Mona pokes at her cake. It's a store-bought one from down the street, $5.99 at the local grocery store, but so far she's never seemed to mind. Instead, Mona hums and inspects a piece of deep brown cake. "'It takes a lifetime to die, and no time at all.'"

Nolan snorts. "Who was it that said that? Bukowski?"

"Mhm."

"I bet you met him, didn't you?"

Mona only smiles.

She's gone in the morning and for the next thirty days. No goodbye, no explanation. There is only the scent of pine needles lingering in the kitchen and a waning full moon that seems more human than her.
