**&lt; A Doctor Stole My Heart &gt;**

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm dying. I suppose Monday morning is as good a day as any. The flight staff will be inconvenienced, but at least I got an aisle seat. They'll be able to move my body to the back of the plane more easily like that.

"Are you alright buddy?"

A plump older man seated to my left casually asks me as he appears more focused on munching on his second bag of chips. I can't even spit out the words to respond as the intense pressure inside my chest makes me wonder if my organs are going to explode. I think this is what they call a heart attack.

Having not responded, my questioner decides not to get involved and returns to his snack. That's right "buddy", go back to your artery-clogging, cheese coated oil and you'll be joining me shortly.

As I'm contemplating how a 24 year old in average health could be having a heart attack, murmurs begin spreading through the passengers.

"He looks like he's in pain. Hey! This guy needs help! Is there a doctor here!"

A girl in a college sweatshirt across the aisle is the first to take action. The ambient chatter begins to erupt as my spectators look for a doctor. The closest flight attendant comes to my side. She's sweating buckets while frantically looking around for anyone to respond to the call for a doctor.

"Sir...aaagh...It's going to be alright...aaagh! Doctor! Anyone!"

The young attendant appears to be on the verge of tears as she tries to reassure me. It looks like she just started this job recently and is in way over her head. I'm sorry about that. After her call for help, a few other people make their way back to where I'm seated. None of them look very sure of themselves.

"Aaagh...are any of you doctors?"

"I'm a podiatrist. I'm not sure if I'll be much help."

"What are you going to do, huh? Give him a foot massage?"

"I did say I wasn't sure how much help I'd be. But what about you?"

"I'm a veterinarian."

"That's great! When he passes you can look after his pets if he has any. Or were you planning to put him down yourself?"

"Aaaagh...waaahh..."

While the gathering was bickering amongst themselves, the flight attendant burst into tears. Well, it looks like none of these people can help me. I wonder how much longer this is going to take. The pain is starting to get pretty annoying. As I resign myself to my fate, I notice another passenger stand up and begin walking towards the crowd.

With everyone blocking my view, all I can see is long, beautiful scarlet hair and a pristine white lab coat swaying in between the gaps as the passenger makes their way towards us. It's strange. Even with all the commotion, I can still hear each step this person is taking as they get closer. Right now, all that exists are those footsteps and the excruciating pain in my chest.

*tup...tup...tup*

Then the steps sto. My vision is starting to blur, but I can just make out the face that belongs to that graceful rhythm. She's a doctor. One that might actually be able to help. If the lab coat wasn't a dead give away, her face certainly is. Even given the circumstances, she's remarkably calm, like she's been in this kind of situation before. The longer I stare at her, the more it feels like time is slowing down. Why hasn't she said anything yet? Help me, please.

Although my vision fades even worse as I continue watching, I'm still able to notice the corners of her mouth begin to curl up. Is she smiling? I know I said I was ready to die, but come on. What's wrong with you? At least try to help me.

At this point I can't really make anything out. Maybe I can at least have a nice view before I move on. I slowly turn my head to look out the window. It looks like I want to talk to the guy from before.

"...sorry buddy. This is my last bag..."

I can't really make out what he's saying. However, with the last of my senses I take one last look out the window past him. What? What's that on the wing? It looks like...a little monster. Then my world goes black.

&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;

The next thing I know, I gain some sort of consciousness. I guess I can't really call it that, because I'm pretty sure I just died. That's just how it is. My life is over, huh. Now that I look back, I never did much. Average grades in school. Didn't stand out too much. I never felt like I had some amazing calling. I did get a job right out of college that required me to fly a lot. I got to see many different places, so my life wasn't completely uninteresting.

If I do have one regret, it's that I didn't ask out that one girl from the small coffee shop by the airport. Since I traveled a lot, I would stop there frequently. She always had this warm aura about her. Even though I kept my orders and greetings very basic, she would always try to strike up a conversation. What I found most peculiar was how she would get excited about some new drink they made or some new coffee beans they bought. She would go into minute details such as where the beans came from, the local history, the best way to brew them, etc. People who can take the simplest things in this world and generate such fascination and wonder, they always seemed to be the most interesting to me.

That being said, my life is over now. It's time to move on. But where am I supposed to go? The world around me is dark and silent. Surrounding me appears an infinite void with small specs of light here and there, almost like stars. With no sense of direction, I decide to just start walking. I take a step forward and it sounds like I'm walking over very shallow water. After some time, I come across what appears to be a rowboat.

To either side of the boat are two floating doors. The door on the left is black with glowing red cracks like embers and thorns wrapping around the edges. I go to turn the knob and immediately jump back in pain.

"Ow...that's sizzling hot."

The metal doorknob becomes violently bright before it melts away. I won't be able to use that door now. Not that I really wanted to, but the door to the right doesn't look like it wants any guests. It's pure white with solid gold around the frame. The most notable feature though, is the massive silver chains wrapping the door shut with a padlock.

"What to do now."

The boat must be my only option, but where would I go? As I get in, I start to see a light off in the distance.

"Might as well start rowing."

"Stop. You want to live, right?"

As I'm about to grab the oars, I hear a raspy female voice call out to me. Then a hand with a purplish hue reaches out from the void.

"Who are you?"

"Does that actually matter right now? I saw you on the plane. Right before you passed out your face was miserable. Tears were running down your cheeks. It looked like you wanted to live."

Was I...was I sad? I suppose I was. But that is only natural. People usually don't want to die.

"Listen. I can't wait much longer. Take my hand."

"But..."

"If you take that boat and head towards the light, you'll truly be dead."

I peer over to the light and then back at the floating hand. I reach out towards it hesitantly. That's when she grabs my wrist...hard. The grip is so tight that if this were my normal body she definitely would have broken something.

"Besides, if you ever want to come back here, I can send you here myself, teehee."

Did she just say she'd kill me? And what's with the "teehee" is she trying to be cute? I'm not sure I can really trust her, but before I can protest I get pulled into the void.
