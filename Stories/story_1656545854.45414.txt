"I don't understand," The vampire countered, "Vampires are the natural predator to man. There was a time where entire armies would flee from a small detachment of vampire warriors."

"Mankind evolved." I explained, "We replaced swords with muskets, then replaced muskets with rifles. One man with an AR-15 can mow down a group of people in less time than it takes a vampire to kill one person." I pulled my phone out of my pocket, holding it up to the vampire, "Alternatively, a man can tear a person apart emotionally without ever meeting them. Break apart their friend group, get them fired from work, make their life feel so worthless that they'd rather end it themselves than try to pick up the pieces."

"And that's just a few options. Someone could poison my drink or hire a sniper to shoot me from several blocks away. I could be killed quickly, or tortured for weeks by a sadist. I could be killed in a spur of the moment decision, or after methodical planning. A hungry wolf only has one or two ways to kill a rabbit. Mankind has spent thousands of years finding new ways to inflict pain onto each other."

As I talked, I saw my undead compatriot's expression change several times. From confusion, to horror, and eventually to pity. "So..." They muttered, "Some things never truly change, do they?"

"They don't," I replied, "No matter how far we evolve as a race, there's always going to be that creative bloodlust that drives us to find new ways of killing each other. Don't get me wrong, most people aren't sociopaths or sadists, but I'm a lot more scared of the ones who are than I am of someone with a different diet."

As grim an outlook as it was, the vampire smiled softly before patting me on the shoulder, "I think I might like you..."
