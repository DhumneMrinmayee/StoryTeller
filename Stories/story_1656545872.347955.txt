**Eirika the Undying mini story - "That One Time Kuutod Was Too Fucking Lazy To Represent Himself, So I Had To Go Instead"**

The place where I was sent was quaint, certainly nothing like the Silver Temple I do most of my work in. I adjusted my half-mask into a more comfortable position, ensured my hair was covering the other side of my face, and slid the hood of my cloth-of-silver cloak over my head.

Lord Kuutod, the Daemon that gave me and my family immortality, caught wind that there was a small cult of destructionists calling for the aid of *any* god or goddess of annihilation.

Certainly the Moon Death is a worthy candidate. 

I knocked on the door of the deaplalated church to be greeted by a rather shocked acolyte in black robes. It's always with the black robes with these cultists.

"You don't look very... destruction-y," the door opener blinked.

I pushed my way past. "Were you expecting flame, smoke, and lightning? Please, Lord Kuutod is the one blessed with theatrics. I am merely his Head Priestess, and I have been tasked with conferring with you."

"Kuutod?" the head cultist laughed. "Why would we need all dead god to do our bidding?"

I circled around their pentagram, reading the arcane language written within. "You called for him by name."

"Impossible!"

A gust of wind, and the candles went out, only the moon illuminating the interior through the shattered stained glass window.

"Lucky, or unluckily, for you all, my Daemin is too lazy to deal with underlings as yourselves," a smile of pure darkness spread on my face. "And you all make a worthy sacrifice to him."
