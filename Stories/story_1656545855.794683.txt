I was born into the Sevette family. The Sevette family is one of the few families in the States that have been blessed with the genetic mutation we call “powers”. We’re real life superheroes. Not like we can TELL anyone this. “No my mom can’t shapeshift! She just….” There comes the lie. We’ve been doing this for centuries now. Lying is basically in our blood, probably why all of us are human polygraphs. If we tell anyone the real truth, we’ll become science experiments. Not to mention, sellouts. Our aunties always told us about the horror stories of the gifted ones. “They pull of your limbs to see if they come back!” “They’ll sleep deprive you then make you run a marathon!”. We grew to fear the outside world. More specifically, doctors and biologists. I had invisibility, well that’s not what I told people. I just “Can teleport”. I hated living a secret double life. I couldn’t trust ANYONE. I had nightmares of my secret getting out. I feared being called a freak and arrested and being locked away from everyone forever. Then I found out the REAL truth. (I know, A LOT of lies here) The fear-mongering the children of “the gifted families” went through was all for nothing. Powers were common and celebrated. We weren’t freaks or people to be feared. We were NORMAL, something I wished to be since the womb. My entire life, my whole upbringing was a lie. And I planned to let the ENTIRE Sevette family know.
