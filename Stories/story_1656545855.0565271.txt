Don’t be desperate, they said. Fiona and Gwyn are bad news, they said. You’re still getting over Ashley cheating on you so don’t be stupid, they said.

Damn it though, when two gorgeous women zero in on you at the trashy party your friends dragged you to, and they laugh at your jokes &amp; wanna go home with you, how could you refuse? I didn’t.

Which was why a gorgeous redheaded vampire and a beautiful blonde werewolf were chomping down on my neck like I was a juicy grilled steak. 

Painful? Yes. Erotic? … 

“Oh my your neck’s real red. Gwyn you chomped too hard.” Fiona said amidst wiping her lips of blood. Some dripped down and yeah, I was kind of terrified at the sight of it. 

“Oh excuse me Mrs Leech. You made quite a mess on your side.” Gwyn smirked all the while caressing me. I couldn’t help but stare at her fangs all the while.

And then I felt it. Sure, when Fiona and Gwyn transformed earlier they warned me about what could happen. Sure, I was down for anything monster or not. But oh man. Feeling my blood go cold and hot, my organs shift and turn, and the hairs all over grow rapidly all over, was… a feeling.

The ladies watched as I writhed all over screaming my head off. I could only think about one thing through all the excruciating pain.

“If we bite you, there’s a 99 percent chance your body will react negatively to the vampiric and werewolf gene. We tend to get excited when in heat so that forewarning is there.”

The room felt like it was spinning. I felt like I was floating. My vision blurred. And then I was on the ground again.

The girls were looking at me but I was looking down at them. I was in no more pain. But wait a minute, Fiona and Gwyn are 6 feet tall. I’m only 5’3. Then I looked at the mirror.

“I’m an ostrich?”
