A dragon-like man sits on a large stone throne draped with a red and gold throw. Sitting on a pillow across from him, a young boy with black hair and a large scar across his face looks up in earnest.

Draco: "Your ability... it'll be hard to conceal. Considering its internal mechanics."

Flugel: "Not everybody has the Demon Eyes or thousands of years of experience. I'd say something like 'I can cut people' would suffice."

Draco: "Yes, but anybody with a brain will realize that it's more of an invisible whip or sword than simply 'cutting'."

Flugel: "Djinn?"

Flugel looks to the corner of the room, where a large man in armour stands, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.

Djinn: "I feel that revealing you ability would fare better. At least you can increase the potency of your cuts."

Draco: "Modern sorcery has no basis in tradition. It is all baseless assumptions made by philosophers."

Flugel: "But Djinn makes a point, revealing my hand is a viable option."

A young girl bursts through the door, yelling at the top of her lungs.

Eris: "DJINN! FOUND YOU!"

Djinn: "Tch. I told you to train with Droma, go away."

Eris: "C'mon! You know she's too strict!"

Eris pouts and sits on the floor.

Flugel: "I'll think about a strategy in my room."

Draco: "That's fine. But you will not eat until you find a strategy, or at least the beginning of one."

Djinn: "Isn't that a bit harsh?"

Flugel: "It's fine, I had three meals yesterday, I'll be fine for at least a few more days."

Djinn: "Alright. Don't push yourself too hard though."

Flugel: "See ya, Djinn. Excuse me, Master Draco."

Draco: "You are excused."

Flugel walks out of the room, Eris follows him.

===

Flugel walks down the halls of the temple, immersed in thought.

Eris: "This strategy stuff sounds boring. Spar with me."

Flugel: "Not today, I have to think of a strategy for concealing my ability in case my enemy gets close to figuring out what it does."

Eris: "Hmm. Then spar me, you can come up with a strategy that way."

Flugel: "I can't even use my ability against you, you'd die."

Eris: "I'm stronger than you!"

Flugel: "Sure, but if we were to fight for real... I'd probably win. I think."

Eris: "Prove it."

Flugel: "... Really?"

Eris: "If you win, you prove your point. But if I win, you have to help me clean the kitchen and bathrooms."

Flugel: "If I win, you have to help me sweep the balconies and clear icicles."

Eris: "Grr. Fine."

===

Flugel and Eris stand 5 meters apart from each other.

Flugel: "Only rule: No killing."

Eris: "Yup. I've brought my blunt blade."

Flugel (Thoughts): *Can I make it blunt? I tried it earlier, and it still made a shallow cut*

Eris: "Let's begin"

Eris holds her longsword high in an ox stance; sword above head, pointed towards the opponent. Flugel is unarmed, he takes a standard fighting stance.

Eris takes the initiative, charging in with a wide slash from her blade. Flugel blocks the blade, reinforcing his arms with mana. Eris retracts her blade, taking a swift step back, then steps back in with a thrust. Flugel voids the thrust through a sidestep, then slides forwards into a sidekick. Eris brings her arms up, blocking the attack. Flugel releases the stored charge in his foot, unleashing a lash of mana. Small cuts appear on Eris' forearms. Eris' grip on her sword loosens, she steps back, but Flugel follows up, pointing his right forefinger and middle finger towards Eris' throat. A small bead of blood drips down onto her chest.

Eris: "... You win."

Flugel: "I'd say, if I wasn't able to block blades with my ability, you'd have won."

Eris: "Hmph. I didn't use my ability, of course you'd win."

Flugel: "You wanna go again?"

===

Inside a small room, Djinn soaks a towel in dissolved medicine, handing it to a beaten-up Flugel sitting on his bed.

Flugel: "Thanks, Djinn. Don't know what I'd do without you."

Djinn: "Die, most likely. You know how Eris gets when she's upset."

Flugel: "Honestly, I didn't think it was this bad. But hey! I won my first duel against her."

Djinn: "You did?"

Flugel: "It's why she got pissed."

Djinn looks at Flugel sternly.

Flugel: "Sorry, it's why she was upset."

Djinn: "Heh. Honestly, it's about time she started losing to rival students. She's a lot like Juyo in that way. I don't think a single student beat him while he stayed here. And by the time he left... Only Draco could fight on even footing."

Flugel: "What was he like? Juyo."

Djinn: "He was cold. He hated this place, and rightfully so."

Flugel: "Really?"

Djinn: "Yeah, Draco brought him here after burning down Norsa Rie, taking him from his home."

Flugel: "Why did Draco do that?"

Djinn: "Who knows... I wasn't even a student back then, just a kid living near the mountains."

Flugel: "I see."

Djinn: "If you ever want to talk, you can come to me. You always know where to find me."

Flugel: "Yeah."

Djinn: "Take some rest, I'll have a newbie deliver some porridge for you."

Flugel: "But I'm not supposed to-."

Djinn: "Shh. It's fine as long as Draco doesn't find out."

Flugel: "Thanks, Djinn."

Djinn leaves the room, shutting the wooden door behind him. Flugel falls asleep.

A bony hand covered in fresh blood juts out of Hunter's torso, The rest of the skeleton looming ominously behind him. The skeleton pulls out it's hand. The skeleton goes to attack Flugel, but Flugel takes it out with a single punch. A vampire with white hair and grey skin stands in the shadows just out of sight.

Diogenes: "Aw. I hoped to take both of you out with just one. Oh well, this'll be more fun kehehe!"

Flugel: "I'M GONNA KILL YOU!"

Diogenes (Playful): "Oh wow! That sounds fun!" :D

---

Diogenes holds the half-elf up by his throat. His second arm lodged inside the victim's heart, a blade of blood sticking out from the half-elf's back.

Flugel: "^(Steven?...")

Diogenes: "This thing had a name? Oh well. He's dead now. Another point for me!"

Flugel: "***IS THIS ALL JUST A GAME TO YOU?! DIOGENES!***"

Diogenes: "And if it is?"

---

A tall elf with blue hair stands, slashed and tattered from a visibly hard battle. His broken blade grasped firmly in his right hand. Juyo smiles softly towards Flugel.

Juyo: "^(It's ok. I've got this.)"

A projectile of blood shoots through Juyo's head, splattering his brains onto the floor.

---

Flugel: ***"JUYO!"***

Flugel jumps up from his bed, cold sweat dipping down his forehead.

Outside of the window, stars illuminate the sky.

Flugel: "A nightmare..."

Memories of simpler times flood into Flugel's mind.

---

A confused sorcerer waits in a defensive stance in front of Juyo.

Sorcerer: "What was that? Doesn't your ability shoot out lightning?"

Juyo: "Part of my ability, yes. My actual ability uses the 'charge' created by my lightning to manipulate the objects around me. I can assign charges to objects, then, based off the charges I have assigned, I can attract or repel objects."

Sorcerer: "I see."

Flugel: "Are you sure revealing you ability's a good Idea?"

Juyo grins smugly.

Juyo: "Its ok. I've got this."

---

Flugel curls up, sobbing faintly.

=====

Back in the throne room, Flugel stands facing Draco.

Draco: "What have you decided?"

Flugel: "I've decided that I will reveal my hand."

Draco: "Why?"

Flugel: "Because that's what my master taught me."
