They wondered why it always seemed to end like this. After the last long quests full of stress, danger stress and ridiculousness in general, they really wanted to take a break... But due to the sorely needed equipment repairs and other unexpected costs they had to do at least one other quest. Luckily for them, a D- quest should be enough to cover the rest of the expenses and should have been a relaxing change of pace for them.

Unfortunately that was not the case... not by a long shot. They didn't know who approved this quest but they'll would really like a word with that person. Not only did the 'cat' managed to get lost **in one of the most dangerous areas you know**, the cat was in fact far from what you would call a normal housecat.  It had, for one, the size of an elephant, had fangs that were, frankly too large for it's mouth and not only that it did not appreciate being followed no matter the amount of snacks the adventurer brought along. 

So, to state the obvious, they had better days. The most frustrating part of all of this was that they were still expected to capture the damn thing instead of killing it. Which they thought was fair enough, but it made their job so much harder... Days went by where the quest went nowhere, it was very smart and elusive. And with every failed capture, it for harder and harder to do other attempts for them. They cursed as they set up a trap for the final time, "I did not want to use this, but that thing doesn't give me much choice." The creature, ever so wary, spotted them but its luck ran out. After all, the adventurer had been preparing this trap for way longer than they'd liked. The creature ran headfirst into the illusion spell, which was hiding a tree. The unearthing of the tree cause the sleeping powder and net traps to set of and with that it was over. 

After applying a shinking spell and putting the creature in their inventory they returned to the man that started this nonsense. After generally putting the creature next to the farmer they said with a bitter tone "I don't know in what world this is a D- quest but you are out of your mind!" The farmer laughed and said, "Well, it **was** a D- quest, it only got like this because you took your damm time starting this quest. This is the consequence of your procrastination."
