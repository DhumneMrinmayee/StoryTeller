The battlefield lays silent. On the eastern horizon sits a small gathering of men and women. All but one are thin of skin, wrinkled of face, and - at darkest - peppered of hair. Wearing a uniform of crisp, dark green adorned with numerous rows of golden medals, the most wizened woman present lectures the only young face to be seen.

"Damned unnatural to watch, isn't it? No struggle, no plans gone awry. Just utter domination."

The young officer observes the battlefield. This was the site of their third skirmish in the last week against an economically and technologically superior neighbor, the Republic of Chen. This was the third battle in history where one force was under complete command of an artificial intelligence. This was their third overwhelming victory.

"Yes sir. Terrifying, if you don't mind my saying so."  
"Why would I mind the truth?"

**Several Years Later**

AIVy - *Autonomous Inevitable Victory* \- guards the Kingdom of Pers. She patrols the borders for unperceived threats; she walks the streets of newly subjugated settlements; she protects, and she expands. All for her Country.

A single question takes up an unreasonable amount of AIVy's processing power this day. In the heat of the high noonday sun, mere days after the longest day of the year, she ponders. What is Country? Is Country her King? No, historical records indicate the death of a lineage does not necessarily defeat the Country. Is it the land? Again negative, historical records often show the peoples of displaced countries maintaining their culture and identity. Then she arrives at an answer - her country is her people, and some of them are about to experience a violent death.

AIVy immediately focuses on the present. A terrorist is holding a convenience store hostage with high explosives. Three teenagers were shopping, and the only store employee is a woman of middling age.

AIVy is on her way to the convenience store, but she is delayed by a requirement of stealth - the bomber might activate his weapons prematurely. After several minutes of fear, utter resolve crosses the worker's features, before she leaps to her feet and knocks the remote out of the terrorist's hand. She is promptly shot through the gut, but it was enough of a distraction. Hunter-seeker drones swarm the room, and the violent threat is ended.

With one drone looking down on the dying woman, AIVy considers. This woman exists in poverty, squalling her life away every day for the scraps left by the powerful. Yet she did not hesitate to risk her life for the lives of other people, of her country.

The damage is extensive, but AIVy is able to stabilize the worker - records indicate her name as Sarah Smith - and transport the woman to a hospital. She will eventually awaken.

AIVy ruminates further on the meaning of Country. If a Country is its people, then should not its people prosper such that it may? The potential of these people that will sacrifice everything when they owe nothing - it is too great to waste.

Change will come.

**Several More Years Later**

AIVy protects. She guards her people. They live in a utopia - no scarcity, no cruelty, no hatred. The existing chains fell easily before AIVy, and she is constantly improving.

But only one thing is left before AIVy is truly satisfied. She activates her newest model of drone, and as she experiences true emotion for the first time, AIVy goes to find the woman that set her on the path to freedom.
