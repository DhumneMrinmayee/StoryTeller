"The perfect shot!" Said the alcoholic as he tossed the contents of the glass down his gullet.

Agent 47 was confused. "The perfect shot?" He asked. "You got the part where your head whips back right, but it's a bullet that goes in there, not a drink."

"The perfect shot," said the photographer wistfully, watching his drink swirl. "Is the shot I'd take of your shot hitting the man taking a shot."

"If you took a shot of my shot, I'd have to shoot you too!" Exclaimed 47, wondering at the stupidity of his barmates. "No one is allowed to shoot my shots."

"I'd take another shot," said the alcoholic.

"No you wouldn't," said 47. "I only ever need one."

The bartender poured the alcoholic another shot. The alcoholic tossed it back and groaned. "I'm not... feeling so hot..." he stumbled away from the bar towards the bathroom. Agent 47 stood wordlessly and followed him, stretching a piano wire taut in his hands. They went into the bathroom. A few seconds later, Agent 47 emerged alone.

"Good day," he said to the photographer, and left.

"Excellent work, 47," said a voice in 47's ear as he strolled down the alleyway. "The money is being wired to your account as we speak."
