We stare at each other for a while. I break the silence first.

"So...what happens now?"

"Now I wait for the next assassin. Maybe he'll do a better job."

"...Excuse me?"

"You didn't think you were the only assassin here today, did you? All my enemies in one place in this castle, making a peace treaty. Of course, it would serve the criminal underworld and anarchist factions more were I to die. As such, I fully expect a few more Assassins by the end of the night."

"Ok but what happens to me?"

"You can go, you were terrible."

I frowned at him. A few hours ago, I learned that he had been responsible for the death of my sister in Texcoco. Now, instead of making an example, he was just letting me go. Sweat poured down my skin, anxiety filled my soul. In a quick movement, I turned my back to him, expecting horror beyond death.

It never came. I walked home without people sparing me a second glance. I was, after all, a chef who got a bit too ahead of himself. At any rate, I wished to do nothing more with this conspiracy of assassins and kings.

When I reached my home, I struggled to reach for my keys, the fear of an arrow sticking into my back, plunging into the ground, awakening in a torture chamber to be castrated for all who could see. Nothing happened. I opened the door and slid right in. I thought to myself about tonight. Would I return to being a chef the following day without incident?

I too a deep breath. Then, something bright appeared out of the darkness. I turned around and a woman casually sat on my chair, aiming her wheellock pistol at my face. She spoke with a calm demeanour

"You were not supposed to start until midnight."
