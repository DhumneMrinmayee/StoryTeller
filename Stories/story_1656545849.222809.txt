Wading through the waist deep cave full of dead adventurer bodies, you notice that all of them seem to have suffered an explosive exit wound from the ass. It was a mess, their pants/underwear/skirts (one guy had a trash bag with holes in it for pants) were all exploded through as if their butt cheeks were being ballistics tested with a 12ga shotgun. You don't know what in the fuck could have done this, but that suppository you took from one of the bags of the earlier adventurer bodies was called "level 5 anus barrier" and went in like a golf ball covered in icy hot. You don't know how good level 5 is but you figured anything extra between your ass and whatever got these guy's asses is a good thing. You stop, your stomach starts to ache a little making a gurgling noise. You really hope that pill wasn't the egg of a level 5 anus burier beetle. Nope, it wasn't thank god. But that gallon of mountain dew you drank out of that water fountain with the demon statue pissing in it was now starting to sit none too well. Pulling down your pants you begin pissing onto the side of the cave wall. A centipede the size of a costco hotdog bursts from a hole in the rock face, clambering onto you stomach and diving down your pants straight toward your taint. To your great relief you feel it suddenly freeze as you uncontrollably shit your pants, the centipede now encased in what looked like white plastic falls down your pants leg and onto the ground. That centipede must have been under level 5. Reaching back into your medicine bag of murdered adventurer supplies, you decide to go for the level 10 pill this time. 

Then, you look back toward the entrance of the cave and think: "You know what, selling stuff wasn't so bad." The level 10 pill vibrates in your hand as small bumpy protrusions appear on its surface, flowing in every direction. "Yeah, no." you mutter as you drop the bags from your shoulders and begin walking back towards your not so bad life.
