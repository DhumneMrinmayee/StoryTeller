"Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship," Yoda ordered.  
  
  
  
The clone nodded and raised his blaster. He took aim and fired. The bolt hit the side of the ship, causing a shower of sparks.  
  
  
  
"Good," Yoda said. "Now do the same to the other ships."  
  
  
  
The clone nodded and fired again. This time, his bolt hit the ship's engines, causing it to explode.  
  
  
  
Yoda watched the battle unfold, his eyes narrowed in concentration. He could see the Jedi and the clones fighting on the ground. He could also see the ships hovering above, firing at the army below.  
  
  
  
"You are focusing all your fire on the ships, yes?" Yoda asked.  
  
  
  
"Yes," the clone said.  
  
  
  
"Good," Yoda said. "It is a trap."  
  
  
  
The clone stared at Yoda, his mouth agape. "What?" he said. "How can it be a trap? The enemy is right there."  
  
  
  
"Exactly," Yoda said. "That is the trap."  
  
  
  
"But if we don't shoot them, they will shoot us," the clone said.  
  
  
  
"Precisely," Yoda said. "That is why you should not shoot them."  
  
  
  
The clone stared at Yoda. "I don't understand," he said.  
  
  
  
"You are a soldier," Yoda said. "I am a Jedi Master. I know these things."  
  
  
  
"But how can it be a trap if they are right there?" the clone asked. He looked up, trying to keep an eye on all the ships at once. He raised his blaster and fired at the nearest one. The bolt hit the ship, causing it to explode. The clone looked back at Yoda, a confused look on his face. "I thought you told me to shoot them."  
  
  
  
"I did,"  
  
  
  
Yoda looked at the clone, his eyes filled with wisdom and knowledge. "The ships are merely a distraction," he said. "The real enemy is the army below. If we focus all our fire on the ships, they will be able to overrun us."  
  
  
  
The clone looked at the army below, trying to comprehend what Yoda was saying. It was true that the ships were a distraction, but he couldn't just stand by and let them shoot at the army. He raised his blaster and fired at the nearest ship. The bolt hit the ship, causing it to explode. The clone looked back at Yoda, a confused look on his face. "I thought you told me to shoot them."  
  
  
  
"I did," Yoda said. "But you should not have shot that one. The ship was only a distraction. The real enemy is the army below."  
  
  
  
The clone looked at the army below and saw that the clones were starting to lose ground  
  
  
  
The clone looked at the army below and saw that the clones were starting to lose ground. The clones were brave, but they were no match for the overwhelming force of the enemy. The clone knew that they needed help, but he didn't know how to give it.  
  
  
  
Then he heard Yoda's voice in his mind. "Use the Force, my young apprentice," Yoda said. "Feel the Force flowing through you. Use your anger to fuel your strength. Use your hatred to empower your blows."  
  
  
  
The clone did as he was told. He felt the Force flowing through him, empowering him. He raised his blaster and fired at the army below. The bolts hit their targets, causing the clones to stumble. The clone charged forward, striking down the enemy with his lightsaber. He was outnumbered and outmatched, but he didn't care. He was fueled by the Force, and nothing could stop him.  
  
  
  
The clone was outnumbered and outmatched, but he didn't care. He was fueled by the Force, and nothing could stop him. He fought with all his strength, slaying the enemy clones one by one. soon, the army was defeated, and the clones were victorious.  
  
  
  
Yoda was proud of his young apprentice. He had shown great strength and courage in battle. He had used the Force to overcome his enemies, and he had proven himself to be a true Jedi Knight.
