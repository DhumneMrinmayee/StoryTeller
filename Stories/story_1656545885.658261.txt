A man walks in and informs everyone he'll give a free memory wipe to anyone who walks out alive the next morning before walking out. A few people just leave, the rest of the night becomes a tense series of "accidental" deaths and straight murders, he is the only survivor... when he leaves the men comments he never asked them to kill each other for the memory wipe and tells the protagonist that he gets the memory wipe if he wants it... the ending I'm keeping to myself, "Last call at Morder Bar" is coming to a library near you in December 2022 ðŸ™ƒ
