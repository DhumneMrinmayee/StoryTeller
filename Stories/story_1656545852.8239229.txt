Killer King

"You are mearly a boy no older then my own when King Richard took his life! Why come so far to face me child?" Lord Logan the Dark lord of the volcano plains called out to the boy lowering his Sword.
"The King has taken my Betrothed and will kill her unless I return with your head!" The boy replied raising his Sword to Strike.
Lord Logan knocked the sword from the terrified boys hands in a heartbeat. "You come here, on the orders of a man who hath killed my son in cold blood, and has here recent threatened to kill your betrothed! Yet I am the one who you are facing with your sword, doesn't that not makeith sense to though young warriors?"
The boy thought for a second before replying. "You are Lord Logan Dark Lord of the Volcano Plains, why sir hath though not killed me? Unless I have been decived by my King... If what you have foretold is true then I was prepared to kill an innocent man on the order of a killer!"
"I shall train you to be a Warrior and reclaim my kingdom from my brother King Richard, come now and hence forth we shall be enemies no longer!" Logan declared outstretching his hand to the boy on the floor.
The boy took Logan's hand and rose to his feet. "We haven't time, King Richard expects me to return within the fortnight Lord Logan!"
"Then we haven't a second to lose, we shall train ten days then return using my fastest steads!" Logan replied.
"In that case you may call me Peter of the Valley, I'm at your service and in your debt my lord!" The boy Peter told his new Allie with a bow.
"Raise Peter there isn't a need for that, I like you are mearly a man, not a god as Richard tells our people!" Logan told him.

"Then what happened Father?" A boy asked.
"We returned after training for many days and vanquished the Killer King! I married your mother shortly after that Logan, Allas Lord Logan died in the battle and lived not to see his kingdom restored." A older Peter told his Son.
