As I limped into the small, out of the way coffee shop, my body hurting worse than it ever has, I noticed one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen out of the corner of my eye. I couldn't help but approach her and try to initiate a conversation. Being a bit awkward in social interactions, I simply asked if I could buy her another coffee. She then looked me up and down, and replied, "no thank you. Too much coffee makes me jittery. I appreciate the offer but I just can't handle that much caffeine." As I walked away a bit dejectedi noticed the shape of her face, and pictured the sidekick of my mentor's nemesis. Without thinking, I blurted out, "Thermal?" Her eyes quickly opened wide, and I knew it was her. After studying my face for a few seconds, she realized who I was, and almost defeatedly said, "yeah you got me, just one question before you take me in, how do you put up with ghost's bullshit, he's so fucking perfect and self righteous?" I was stunned for a second, because I didn't know how to answer. After staring at her a bit, I managed to say, "You're right, but i don't think think this is the place to discuss it. Theres a great little dive bar about a block north and two blocks east. Let's take a walk there, and I'll buy you a drink.
