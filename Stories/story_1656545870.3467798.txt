Two socks in, one sock out. Two socks in, one sock out. This is how the universe had always worked. It seems strange now, of course, but in those times no one had questioned it, it was just the way of the world. As much a facet of reality as rain drops sliding down a car window on a stormy night: two merging into one before sliding off into the abyss.

I can't claim to have been a great scientist, but like Newton and Einstein before me, I started by simply asking "why?"

"Why does a sock still remain?"

No one had asked this before, but after a single sock hit me on the head it occurred to me that something peculiar was going on. How did that lone sock survive? We all knew heat made socks evaporate, that much was obvious, but why only one?

Decades went by, and the question only I was asking started driving me to insanity. Why could no one else see the importance of this research? Why could no one else see that something was happening? I started hallucinating. Monsters and dragons would appear to me in my sleep, taunting me, leaving socks behind everywhere they went.

During the darkest years the dragons would follow me around during the day too. When I was finally at breaking point I trapped the dragons in the dryer, turned it on, and watched. I planned to destroy them, get them out of my life, but what I saw shocked me. The dragons were taken a single sock of each pair. I put my head inside and tucked into the underside, there it was, a nest of lost clothing and pocket change, and a family of tiny dragons shocked to see me.

I knew then that the dragons were not just in my dreams, they were real, and this is how I would get my Nobel prize.
