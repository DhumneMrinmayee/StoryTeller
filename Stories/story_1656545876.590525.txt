It's been less than a month since the announcement to the world that time travel was discovered...invented...idk what to call it but you get the gist - we can now explore the past. Of course, for a simpleton like me, the first thought is how I could use it to fix small things in my life that would make things easier NOW. But all it took was reading past the article headline (*easier said than done*) to realize that we could go back in time, but not make any changes. Hell, we could barely even interact with the people in the past. If you spoke to someone on a time travel they will answer but then almost immediately forget. 

So far we've learned some cool shit. 

The Great Pyramids, not really giant tombs after all! 

Stonehenge, turns out a glacier did that, what are the odds?!?  

I could go on and on about what we got wrong and what we got right, but you can Google that yourself. I'm here to tell you about (God my English teacher would kill me if she read that sentence right now) what happened to ME.

I'm not sure whose bright idea this was but TimeTravel was introduced to the Google Play Store. The craziest thing about this is how mad those iPhone users got; so much for those green bubbles now - ha! got em! I guess, the assumption was why not capitalize on time travel if there were no risks of changing the future anyway. Why iPhone users were excluded, well I think that's pretty obvious. 

&amp;nbsp;

I should stop for a minute and tell you a little about me. I'm Charles, I like to go by Chuck, and I'm about as interesting as you might expect your average 30 something Chuck in the Midwest to be. Average intelligence, below average appearance (*especially if you're basing that on successful TikTokers*). The best word I've ever heard used to describe me: milquetoast. Nothing, and I mean nothing, holds my interest for very long and on the flip side no one, and I mean no one, holds interest in me for very long. I'm always looking for something NEW, something INTERESTING. My therapist calls it novelty seeking, but even her I got bored with.

 
The easiest place I've found to get some new, interesting ideas happens to come from conspiracy theories and for whatever reason the easiest place to find those: The History Channel. Now sure, I could try harder and come up with my own ideas, but when they're right there on demand where I can sit and watch it, then that's what I'm gonna do. Milquetoast AND lazy. No wonder people get tired of me. 


So when the TimeTravel app is released my very first thought is to get the answer to questions from the TV series Ancient Aliens. I decided that I would check out every theory from Ancient Aliens starting from season one episode one. I mean, who doesn't love a good binge, am I right? 


If you're even a little familiar with the show, you would rightly assume every single thing has been wrong. No aliens, no crazy ancient technology, nothing. At least not in the locations and times from the show. I've been at this for a while now, and I've had a great time. Then I got to Season 9, Episode 12 "The Alien Agenda". 
Among the places they mention in The Alien Agenda, they briefly mention the Library of Alexandria. You know, the Library that burned for whatever reason but also held all of human knowledge up to that point? As it turns out, lots of people have already been to the library and the entirety of human knowledge at that point wasn't all that interesting. I mean, of course it is *interesting*, it's the Great Library of Alexandria. It's just not interesting *to me* because it's only been a month or so (of public time travel) and no one has found anything in the library that we didn't already know. I almost skipped it. Almost. 

&amp;nbsp;


Anyway, here I am checking out the library. I can't be bothered to really read all of the things (let's be honest, any of the things) in the library. That's for the real researchers. I'm looking for something interesting; something special. Just as I was thinking to myself about how boring libraries are, out of the corner of my eye I see a flash of blue light. Blue light in a candle lit library well before electricity, that's got my interest. But it's gone in a flash and as I scan the room, I don't see anything like a blue light.


I had a vague sense that the light came from just off to my right. I'm sure it's nothing; something I imagined. In that direction I see the shelves of scrolls lined up in aisles. Just like the rest of the circular shaped library. A rotunda - I think that's what this kind of room is called. Probably not but it feels right.  At the end of each row is a marble bust. You know, like the ones you see from ancient Greece. You've seen one, you've seen them all. They're so uninteresting at this point I hardly even clock the faces of of each one.  But now I am looking closely at the bust at the end of the aisle just off to my right where I thought the light came from. My eyes lock directly with the eyes of the bust. I stop. It's a bust of my fucking busted face. 


It's me. Without a doubt. Down to the birthmark on the side of my face above my ear. I know there are only so many faces that have ever existed so this has to be a coincidence. Right? Irregardless, I'm very interested. Novelty acquired. I squat down to get a closer look. My face is now inches from . . . well my face. Conspiracy inspired theories flood my brain. 

&amp;nbsp;
Is this one of my ancestors? -- The first obvious thought. 

&amp;nbsp;
Am I a clone? -- A little wilder but pretty ordinary.

&amp;nbsp;
Do I even exist at all? -- Existential and a little too much. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the moment, I can't come up with any interesting theories, but I'm doing my best okay. 

I'm enamored with this bust of myself. I walk around and around inspecting every inch of it. Thinking. Wondering. Why? Why? My thoughts are running in circles as they do whenever I find that novelty I crave. Lost in thought I do something even now I can't understand, I fingered the bust's nose. 

**FLASH.**

The blue light is now all around me and I can't see anything else. I blink a few times and everything has changed. The grand, ornate Great Library has been replaced by what appears to be a Kmart. Kmart? WTF I haven't been in a Kmart since Martha Stewart ran them into bankruptcy, or whatever happened. I even see a blue light at the end of one of the aisles, ready for a "blue light special." 

**Attention Kmart Shoppers, what the fuck is going on?**

"Chuckie boy, you're here just in time" says a voice from behind me. An oddly familiar voice. I spin around and, you guessed it, it's me -- *again*. This is no bust. This is a full grown, walking, talking me, in a Kmart sales associate vest; *still got a busted face tho*. Circular thoughts racing through my head shoves a lump in my throat. I can't seem to get my words out. It doesn't matter because Kmart Chuck goes "The propane is in aisle 7, we'd better hurry up if we're going to burn the library before they get here." I manage to get out a "Who? What? Why--" and Kmart stops me. 

"**You'll figure that out IF we don't hurry.**"

I'm even more confused but I follow Kmart to aisle 7 and help him load propane into a shopping cart. My thoughts circle in endless loops on top of loops teetering back to baseline from the wildly crazy to the incredibly dull. I know this is an important moment, which makes it damn near impossible to get any of my words out. I can however do what Kmart is already doing, and load propane tanks into his shopping cart. What's that social thing called where people will mimic what other people are doing without realizing it? I can't remember but that's what I'm doing. That's what feels the safest. We load a few propane tanks into a wire metal shopping shopping cart - I forgot that carts didn't used to be plastic. The metal looks so dirty, I don't wanna get grease on my clothes. Without warning Kmart sticks his finger deep in my nose. 

**FLASH **

Blue light is everywhere for an instant and then we're back in the library. My eyes are watering from the pain of Kmart trying to give me a COVID test with his untrimmed nails. I really need to clip my nails, I thought before snapping back, looking around to see the rotunda chock full of people. Not just people, multiples of the same person over and over. 

&amp;nbsp;
Clones? 

&amp;nbsp;
Time Travelers?

&amp;nbsp;
aLiENs?!?

&amp;nbsp;

There are dozens of unique faces and then dozens of copies of those faces. They're all clambering around in a panic. All while there's a rumbling sound rising in the background. Kmart looks at me and says "The paradox room." Like I'm supposed to know what the fuck that means. I just look back at him and without another word, he opens up a propane tank, and snaps a bic from his pocket. 

**Well, Flick My Bick.**

The library is engulfed in flames. That high pitched noise they use in movies after an explosion is actually real?!? I stick my fingers in my throbbing ears. I really do need to clip my nails. My circling thoughts are at a loss but running as fast as they can. They're in more of a downward spiral now really. I'm not thinking of Kmart or the library or the aLiENs, I'm thinking I don't want to burn to death and fire sure is hot.

&amp;nbsp;


All of this happens in an instant and by instinct I tap the quick return button in the TimeTravel app. 


I'm back in my apartment. Nothing has changed. My ears feel better. My nails could still use a trim. It's exactly like every other time I've returned from a trip. No time has passed. I'm not burned. 
I don't know what any of this means. I've tried telling so many people. No one believes me. They've gone back themselves and never seen my bust, or anything else strange in the Library. 


Meanwhile, I've been back many times. The same thing always happens. A flash of blue light, a Kmart, a me who utters the exact lines of dialogue every time no matter what I say, the library is burned.

 &amp;nbsp;

**You'll figure that out IF we don't hurry.**
