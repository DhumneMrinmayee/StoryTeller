"I would like a cherry blossom curly rose brandy with some malte pepper and a cream of villa nueva on top please, oh and on the rocks with a sip of bloody tonga from rio de janeiro, not ripped, thank you"

Ronald Marlow Stevenson, 54, detective from Palo Alto, paused a little before answering.

"Wait, what did you just say ? "

"Are you deaf or dumb ? Where is William, who are you anyway ? "

"William's mother is very sick. I'm helping him out tonight." 

Ronald thought for a second about William's inanimate body just under his feet in the basement.

"William's mother ? He is an orphan ! Who the f*ck are you ?"

"I'm Conrad Wilson i'm a... a barman."

"Really ? So hurry the f*ck up and do as i asked. I don’t need to know your backstory even if you are obviously lying. "

"Thank you. I am searching for a guy named Guy Ritchie. You know him ?"

"Are you a fucking detective ?"

"Yes, i mean, no. He just owes me money, haha you know... here is your coktail."

"That's a bottle of beer."

"Yes. But i must confess i don’t know how to make the coktail you asked."

"You should think about finding another job than detective or barman, you suck at both."

That was pretty harsh and unexpected. Detective Marlow suddenly bursted out in tears and leaved the bar, hiding his face with his large hands, in a pathetic attempt to hide that he was crying like a baby. Guy Ritchie looked at him opening the exit door and going outside. Then, he took the beer, and opened it up.

"Crazy fuking night..." he thought, while drinking it.
