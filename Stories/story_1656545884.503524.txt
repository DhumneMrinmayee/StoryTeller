The moment the ominous message was leaked, mass panic spread through the world like lightning through a metal road. Scientists all over the world scrambled onto their feet to figure out what potential tragedy would soon befall Earth. Not soon after another meteor sized anything between a car and the moon was found to be heading toward Earth, with due impact in 1 month.

So like one would expect, soon enough economies crashed, leaders were assassinated, homicide rate peaked, wars were lost … yadda yadda yadda.

Considering the potential size of the meteor and how far technology has advanced so far, it was nigh impossible to save Earth or to escape from it with such short notice. With that being said, the world fell into a chasm of hopelessness and then hopelessness turn into grief and grief turned into anger and then anger turned into a rocket containing Earth’s strongest nuclear warheads that was set to be sent towards the origin of the meteor to share whatever suffering they could with those who lead them to their doom.

Soon, the warheads were launched, and with that came an end to the ever-growing list of human accomplishments.

The day of reckoning had come. Those who were left prayed about what little faith they had as the sky scorched above them. But once the impact was felt all over the world, it was not death that awaited them, but rather complete silence. Nothing had happened.

Scientists rushed to the site of impact, only to be dumbfounded by a boulder-sized rock that only had a single sentence written on it.

“It is just a prank, bro.”
