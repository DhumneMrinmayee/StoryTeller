&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”After a hun’red years, ya start ta wonder aboot a few thangs. Like why that ridic’lously smart dog o’ yers is still alive, y’know? Ya also start ta wonder how to stop smellin’ like mothballs, but I thank I know the answer to that. And ya wonder whether it’s really worth it ta walk alllll the way to that dang ol’ bathroom jus’ ta take a leak.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”It’s always worth it, master. Always.” My dog replies.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I jump a lil’ in ma easy chair, surprised that I actually said all that out loud. “Yer jus’ sayin’ that cuz ya don’t like cleanin’ up after me.” I cackle. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Remember the rashes, master.” My dog says in that stupid smart edUcated tone o’ his. He thinks he’s all high and mighty jus’ cause he went ta Harvard. The fool of a dog don’t realize that I ain’t ever heard o’ Harvard, so it means nothing ta me every dang time he brings it up. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Yeah, yeah. Now where did I put ma glasses?” I wonder.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”You’re blind, Master. You don’t have glasses.” Ma stupid smart dog says. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Haw, whoops. I didna realize I said it aloud.” I reach around me, gropin’ on the chair arms and the table next ta me afore it hits me. “Well dang me and call me a monkey’s uncle. I do believe I found em.” I put my gnarly hand over my mouth when I realize I said that aloud. I can’t be lettin’ ma dog be gettin’ rid o’ them befoe I can find em again.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Hm? Found what, Master?” Thankfully, ma dog ain’t payin’ too much attention ta me. He’s busy doin’ taxes or some such.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Why, ma pills o’ course. They was in ma pocket all along.” I lie with a smile. And then I reach down in between the cushion and chair that I’m sittin’ on as fast as I can and grope around down there for a minit. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I find em! I jump up and crow like a big ol' rooster I do. And I shove ma glasses that I just found onto ma face and look around for the first time in seventy years. "Why you little rascal! You ain't a dog, you're a wife!" I look at ma hairy woman in shock. "Since when did ya turn into a girl, ol' boy? And ma wife at that!" 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Honey! You can see!?" The old woman asks in shock from where she's doing the taxes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Hey! I'm the only one who's allowed to be shock'd 'round here! Since when did ya turn from a hairy dog into ma hairy wife?" I demand an answer.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Oh dear, your dog died several decades ago, when you thought I died. You seemed so upset about it that I made you believe that I was your dog, and that your wife had actually died. Do you forgive me?" 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Forgive her! Why, she's insane! But I can't let her hear me say that… " I open my mouth and lie through ma teeth with a smile."Why o'course, ma dear. Now where's ma coffee?"
