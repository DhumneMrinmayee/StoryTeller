The war hammer describes an arc directly at my chest, emitting a low whistle. *It's swung with gusto, but the fool doesn't understand impact angle at all, its gonna hit almost flat! no need to block. Best deal with that pesky spearman first.*

**BONG!** My whole cuirass resonates with the impact, far louder and longer than it would were there any flesh behind it. 

*Shit.*  My eyes sweep left as an unholy screech seems to come in the response to the church bell ring I just emitted. I swear it came from Leda, our party's smallest member. She's on her knees, clutching her head. Her armor looks like its crawling over itself, almost liquid. Thankfully, her opponent is staring at her, slack jawed in mute horror, so he's probably not gonna be a threat for the moment

"What the-" is as far as I get before the spearman tries to slip his blade through my eye socket. This of course would not hurt me, but it would be awkward to explain to the party how I got a lobotomy-by-spear without dying, so I focus on ending the little twat. The wet crunch my morning star produces from his skull is quite satisfying. The ring of my pauldron as hammer boy has another go at it, however, is not. **Crunch!**  There, that's better. I round left to support Leda, only to find her back in the game, and eviscerating her opponent with a little more gusto than I entirely feel is healthy. 

*Looks like she just got her bell rung for a second, I probably didn't hear it over my breastplate. Her armor must be even more enchanted than me, with that weird liquid effect, and that's saying something, considering I'm sentient.*

My opponents dealt with, and Leda back up, I take a moment to survey the rest of the fight. Our resident cleric, the aptly named Bones has somehow ended up at the top of the small rise we had made our stand at the bottom of, and is currently in the middle of a ruthless assault, both physical and verbal, against what might be the largest man I have ever seen. 

*She doesn't even seem to stop for breath, and she could make a sailor blush with that mouth. How the hell did she end up a cleric?*  

Her brutality suddenly is ended by a well aimed boot to the chest from her antagonist, which sends her bouncing down the hill.

*Check that, the physical assault was stopped, the verbal just got worse. And how many prayer beads does she have stuffed in that armor to make it rattle like that? A hailstorm on a copper roof would be shamed.*

Judging that the continued cursing is a good sign Bones is okay, I go back to seeing how the rest of the party is faring. Legion, so named for his habit of referring to himself in the plural, is currently surrounded, but only by the dead and dying. I'm moderately concerned that I can't see Ichabod, until I hear his shrieking cackle in the nearby woods, followed by a series of crashes that is pretty clearly him repeatedly bludgeoning his opposite number over the head with his greatshield,  as if it were a chair in some tavern brawl. 

Assured my friends are safe for the moment, I hike my morning star onto my shoulder and start up the hill to go deal with Corn-fed, who is currently making rude gestures and trying to outcurse an obviously winning Bones.

&amp;#x200B;

After Corn-fed's brains paint my morning star, we gather to take stock of our injuries. I am obviously unharmed, though I could use a new coat of lacquer. Leda professes to be uninjured, even when I remind her she took a sword blow to the head. She stares at me oddly for a second before blurting "Oh that! That was nothing, hardly more than a graze, just surprised me is all!" with the kind of cheery tone one normally reserves for agreeing with an especially bad lie that happens to cover up their secret nicely. *Odd girl, that one.* 

Legion gives everybody a fright when we notice the rather copious amount of blood dribbling through the vents on the front of his helm, until he sunnily assures us "It's not ours, one of them tried to get us in a grapple, so we had to bite him!"  As he says this, I think I catch the glint of a great big toothy grin under his helm. Too big, and too toothy. And pointed, like shark's teeth. *It's just the battle fatigue.* I tell myself, knowing full well that armor doesn't get fatigued. 

Bones just quietly mutters about "spending the next week sorting finger bones", whatever that means. She is clearly unhurt, and being our cleric, she would be healing herself if she wasn't, so I don't dwell too hard on her turn of phrase. Besides, it isn't the first time she's used an unusual idiom. Wherever she's from, they have an odd obsession with items of the ossified persuasion.

The last to arrive back at our little camp is Ichabod, whistling tunelessly, the monstrosity he calls a shield slung casually over one shoulder. Last I checked, he wore a white tabard with mint green stripes. currently he is wearing a crimson tabard, with spots in the shades of various bodily fluids. I suppress a shudder. He has been sitting with us a solid five minutes before someone notices an important detail: the head of an axe is just barely peeping out the front of his gorget. 

"Um, Ich, ya got a little something there." Leda says in a voice which screams "I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm failing miserably, because what the fuck!?" while pointing to her neck. Ichabod immediately tries to look down, and receives what is likely a concussion from Bones slamming his head back before he can cut his own throat on the axe head. *How the fuck has he not already? That sucker is in there deep.* Two swift blows to the head from Bones later, Ichabod stops struggling long enough for us to explain his predicament.  

"Praise all the gods I have a thin neck!" he exclaims, "Like a bloody heron, my mother always said! Positively pencil necked!" he rambles on, obviously in a mild panic about his near decapitation.

"Hold still, we will pull it out!" Legion offers helpfully. We all know he is likely the only one who could get a hold of the bit that is still sticking out of the gorget well enough to pull it out. Grip like a shark bite, that one. 

The explosive "NO!" Ichabod utters comes as a bit of a shock to all of us. Any sane man would want that thing out as soon as possible. The thing is a regular sword of Damocles where it sits now: one false move and that's it for you. Well, not that Ichabod is a sane man, but still, he isn't that kind of crazy. I think.

"No, I'll get it myself, thank you, old chum." Ichabod continues in a much more reasonable tone, before standing up and walking off into the night while we stare after him in shock. There is a wrenching shriek of metal on metal as the axe head is pulled free, and I notice Leda's armor shiver.  Ichabod comes back into the light of the fire, tossing the axe head up and down with one hand. He now sports a hastily tied bandana over the wreckage that was his gorget. 

"Sorry, friends, some things a man just has to do himself, like pulling an axe head out of the space reserved for ones neck!" Ichabod jauntily declares.  I look at the axe head in his hands. It's from a great axe, and quite clearly is large enough to hit the back of Ichabod's gorget, which, now that I look at it, is clearly bulging out a bit. 

"Guys, I think we all need to have a serious talk about who we are." I note, gravely. Their suddenly apprehensive postures would be comical, were it not for the knot where my stomach would be telling me I probably looked much the same.
