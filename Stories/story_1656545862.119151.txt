You have no choice. It doesn't matter the result of the galactic war depends on this negotiation. It doesn't matter that trillions have died in the galactic war. It doesn't matter that the millions of daily deaths will resume if the negotiations fail. It doesn't matter the aliens have threatened use of their WMDs, gravity inverter bombs, that will invert gravity in the galaxy making all-stars go supernovae ending all life if negotiations fail. It doesn't matter you passed at the top of your class in anti-boop training specifically in preparation for this negotiation. It doesn't matter that this war began specifically because the humans that first encountered these highly boopable aliens refused to stop booping the aliens after being asked to stop the booping. It doesn't matter that the Emporer, your own father, specifically asked you not to boop the aliens.

No, none of that matters. The only thing that matters is the overwhelming urge to boop the most boopable snout a human being has ever encountered in human history.
