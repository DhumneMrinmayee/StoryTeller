After some timid initial testing i figured out anything i stupidly said came true. 

This was frightening, so i tried putting some control on it so no sudden outbursts of *fuck me* or "*fuck you* would create unfortunate situations. 

"Delay the activation of my ability to manifest changes in reality by one minute." 

I tested this by timing in my phone and requested an Iphone, it appeared one minute later and i chucked it in the trash where it belongs. 

I'll be honest i was incredibly tempted to abuse this power right here and now, but as tempting it was to bankrupt EA, toss all politicians in a hole somewhere and appoint myself CEO of Nintendo, i had to use this power responsibly and intelligently. 

I still decided to drop the poop bag on Kim Jong Un's head though.

I needed help, help that i could at least trust to an extent. 

Well nothing ventured nothing gained, i could just erase minds of things went wrong. 

"Make aware of my powers, all living nobel peace price candidates, and create a chat server identical in working to a Discord chat server, useable only by the aforementioned individuals and myself, provide the aforementioned individuals with a phone with a permanent internet connection and battery life with said chat service available on it.

With that i could at least guarantee most of, if not all people in this group where morally upstanding individuals who either had more knowhow than myself, or the connections needed to use this power without breaking things. 

In the meantime i decided to move all criminally aquired money worldwide to my bank account, return all of it that was stolen, donate 90% of the remaining money to charities and kept 10% for personal use, nothing says i can't look out for myself right? If this power ran out someday i'd hopefully still have that little stash. 

Ah, i got a voice chat request.
