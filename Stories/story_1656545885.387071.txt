So, I (3,906 M/Dragon) have a treasure horde. I'm a "collector of things," so to speak, and I have been collecting for longer than...well, longer than everyone today has been alive. I'm always looking to add more to my treasure, because gold...(le sigh) there's just something about gold, gems...all that sparkling, valuable stuff that just gives me happy, squishy feelings inside.

So, here's the problem: I got a tip from a friend (286 F/Succubus) that a Lich Lord (5,288 M/Dead/Ugly) who was terrorizing a local city died recently, and his treasure was up for grabs...well, when I arrived, the Lich Lord wasn't quite "dead," per se (Hint: Guys, always look for two meanings when you talk to a succubus; they're about as honest as Chicago accident lawyers). He was dead-ish, like Lich Lords are, but still stubbornly clinging to life like dirt on a five-year-old's fingers. Anyway, I went there thinking he was dead--er, "un-undead"-- but that wasn't the case. So, he and I battle it out, and after receiving a few scrapes and bruises, I come out on top. Ol' Bony is no more, and I go home to get some band-aids, and a few carts so I can get the treasure and take it home.

Anyway, while I was out, The LL \*came back to life again,* only weaker this time. Much weaker. Like barely-clinging-to-unlife weaker. Some no-name adventurer types show up and beat him with barely any effort thanks to \*my* labor, and they leave to get carts to get the treasure. 

I show up with my carts first, load up the treasure, and as I leave, the so-called "heroes" show up like a bad case of syphilis, and attack, saying it's their treasure. I fight back, because I killed the LL first. Neither of us want to budge on this. We're currently in a stalemate at a high mountain pass, and damnit the snow is freeeeezing my tail scales off, not to mention the icy-cold wind wrecking havoc on my skin!

**TLDR: I kill a Lich Lord first; "heroes" show up and kill him again; both of us lay claim to the treasure. AITA?**
