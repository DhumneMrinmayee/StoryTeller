*Unnamed ZNN news personality*: "And that concludes General Pain's surprising live press conference in which she through barely held back tears explained to Hyper City and the world how the last 10 years have worn her down and left her chronically depressed. Throughout her speech she appeared to hint multiple times at a desire to hang up the cowl or at the very least take a vacation. Here to respond is my esteemed expert panel to break it all down sentence by sentence including a world renowned body language expert

*the [panel] then proceeds to mock General Pain and call her weak and cowardly for 45 minutes straight before they're suddenly interrupted*

4th panel member: "-abandoning us when we need her the most." 


*a small bomb goes off and Red Menace enters the studio through the newly made hole in the wall gun in hand*

Red: "That's quite enough you overpaid suit and tie hacks. Especially you in the doctors lab coat, body language expert my communism praising ass. Calm yourselves you cowering weenies and stay in your seat General Pain...wherever you are in this dump of a city. 'Madame', you see despite my being a confirmed crazed marxist fanatic, unabashed murderer and the man with the dubious distinction of most attempted armed bank robberies in Hyper City's illustrious history....I am on your side. And as such I am here to voluntarily surrender myself to the authorities, no tricks, no wild and outlandish pre-planned escape attempts. Until you are able to get the help you need I will be at the mercy of Hyper City's deeply flawed justice system and I urge my fellow super villains who have clashed with 'Herr General' to do the same. Despite my submitting to the law for once, I still value my worthless life and will resist if the city attempts to give me the death penalty. Do with that what you will." 

*With his monologue finished Red unloads, breaks down, discards his gun and slides the now separate and useless pieces towards the live audience. And predictably officers rush in and safely secure the unhinged super villain.*
