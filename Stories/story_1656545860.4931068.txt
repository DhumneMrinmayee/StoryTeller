It was not the first time I raced to the magical bookstore, and definitely not the first time I left the dog waiting alone in the apartment. Yet I've never before made that trip with a cat in my arms.


The giant furry guy, who loves to sleep on people like on a comfy cushion and who I call my dog, sure was a troublemaker and a quick learner, but that was on a different level than before...


You might just ask what happened. Well, I will tell you. It ain't a secret in my neighbourhood, that some sort of magic exist. Well, it was a fact almost no one knew, until some years ago, but let's get back.


Just a couple of minutes ago I opened the door expecting a quiet evening, but that wish was... unfulfilled and yes, the pun is intended.


Skramp was munching on something on the carpet and a black cat with neon yellow eyes sat on the windowsill and glared at the mouse trap, that dared to somehow catch his tail. I doubted he put his tail there willingly, but wait... I don't have a cat.


"What the-" I said and that caught the feline's attention.


"Oh thank all the evil angels and nerd demons, you finally made it there! This idiot over there wanted me to turn into a talking mouse!"


Skramp lifted his head and a golden lamp dropped from his mouth.
I could see where that plan of my dog backfired.


"Heeelp" the cat meowed.
