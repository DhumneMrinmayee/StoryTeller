My job has always been to upgrade seemingly archaic slower-than-light ships to new faster-than-light standards. Many ships did not appreciate it, some ships yelled at me, questioned my orders, and so on, but one ship, The Luxrus... that was a special case.

I first came upon the Luxrus in Sector KK-70. As part of my job as Dawnbringer, I broadcast my orders to upgrade ships in all known galactic trade and underground languages on a loop.

When the Luxrus heard my beacon, they responded simply, over a light translated voice:  
*"Dawnbringer, we hear your orders. However, faster-than-light is detrimental to our continued cellular pattern. As such, we refuse your upgrade."*  


Now at first I thought this must be a trick. Exploratory aliens- wouldn't them just being in space be toxic if faster-than-light was?

They must have been sensing my general unease, because they responded:  
*Not all aliens are like yourselves. As for us, the phenomenon you call faster-than-light travel is toxic to us. It burns like the fires of Tyrex, or Kaliomora's Sage Sun. We will only be in your realm for a series of short whiles, as we locate our next dimension to plane shift to. We will erase ourselves from your records once we are settled again.*  


A few days later, I saw no mention of them on our scanners, except for some curious residue left behind, in a long trail.

I wanted to learn more about them, but I had orders. Those came first. So, I went in the opposite direction, continuing to broadcast my orders, but I still wasn't sure I made the right decision.
