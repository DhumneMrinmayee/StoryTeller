He flusters for a bit as I putter around the kitchen, grabbing this and seasoning that. 

"You aren't even the least bit scared?"

"Why would I be?" I ask, leaning over my basket and checking the ratios. "Just because you can kill me doesn't mean you will. Honestly you're probably only here because you're hungry."

I pause to take a look at him.

"You *are* looking a bit dull, when was the last time you ate?"

He huffs and crosses his arms, looking away to mumble something. I  chuckle at him.

"Well, you're just going to have to wait a bit longer. You've been creeping around the yard long enough to disturb my herd, I need to go calm them down."

He looks back up as I heft my basket on my hip. 

"Your herd? Herd of what?" he asks, following me out on the back porch into the night. I point to the edge of the yard, where a couple of does stand watching us. 

"They're just..."

One stands on her hind legs and takes a few steps forward, mouth dropping down and tongue lathering.

I chuckle as he falls silent and say, "Just wait here on the porch and you'll be safe. Honestly you're lucky it was just the Not Deer. Vilkas wouldn't be as forgiving; he's quite protective of me."

He looks horrified as I step off the porch and whispers, "Who's Vilkas?"

I turn and look up at the roof, where the red eyes of the local wolfman stare back down at me.

"Just stay on the porch and you'll be safe. I'll be back to feed you once I get these apples and corn to the Not Deer."
