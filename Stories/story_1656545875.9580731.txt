"I just put the groceries away, man."  


Naturally, my roommate wouldn't listen. He insisted that I get out of the place. What's the use of the good radishes I just bought? They were on sale too.  


Before I could say another word, my roommate rushes out of the house. Must be urgent. I guess I can finally work on dinner without any more distractions. I think that game show I wanted to watch is on later.  


Of course this begs the question, how do I want to cook the radish this time? I had it fried the other week, that wasn't so bad. Bit of a waste of oil though, if I don't add more ingredients. I wonder what else I still have laying aroun---  


"INTERPOL, OPEN UP!!"  


Now what could they want? Is it something urgent? Do they need something taken care of?  


"OPEN THE DOOR!!"  


Alright already, yeesh.  


Door squeaking again. I should put some oil in those hinges later.  


"Can I help you?"  


"On behalf of the United Nations, you are hereby under arrest, come with us Mr. Saitama."  


Does this mean I'm gonna miss my game show?
