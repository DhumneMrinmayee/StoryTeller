"What in Leviathan's name is THIS?" The oldest mage speaks with anger none of the other mages had seen before. "Where did we go wrong?"

The Katastrefo. Also known as "Men behind the Curtain", was supposed to summon a great bringer of doom, a monster that could shake Lucifer's bone, if he has any... Even Shiva pales in comparison to it's power... Or so the story stated. Instead, what appears before these men is a human infant. A purple one, to be exact.

"A cursed breed of universe's greatest destroyer... The only thing abnormal about this baby is its skin color." One mage is reading through the scroll to find the answer they are looking for. "Only the beings with hearts darker than the deepest abyss of Earth can awaken this ancient beast..." "That's it! That's what was wrong with it! BOB! I knew you were too benevolent to be here. You will pay for this!" The oldest mage shouts like a volcano just erupted from his throat, demanding the man named Bob to exit this place. "Lord Moira, I don't think Bob is the cause of this." The man holding the scroll tries to calm the leader of cult down. "What do you mean, Idiofyia?"

"The scroll stated that it's a breed of doom, but there's a small string of text written under it... I just figured out what it said. Everytime it is summoned, a new destroyer will be born to satisfy the need. With that being said, this is what we are looking for, it's just... haven't grown up yet."

"So what you are saying is we have to raise this child until it has the power to shatter the world?" Moira looks at Idiofyia with despair in his eyes. "I am afraid that's the truth..."

From this day, the doomsday cult becomes a family... For the doomsday that is about to arrive in the next 18 years or so.
