As it turns out, dinosaurs really don't make great pets. My most recent attempt at companionship had just flown away with my dinner.

"Yeah, that's right, fly away, Christine, fly away! You didn't stay very long in 2002 either!" I yelled at the retreating form of a pterodactyl.

Yes, I named my 'pets' after my exes. Yes, it was a bad strategy. But the only thing I had left were my memories and the reliving of them through my self-drafted and critically acclaimed dino-soaps, in which I named the predators around me and narrated as they brutally battled each other. Life without YouTube was devastatingly boring.

I thought for a while, when I was young and naive of the cretaceous ways, that me being here would somehow speed up history. That the simple fact of my presence would make electricity appear. I was so so painfully wrong.

It turned out that advancements in technology required advanced people. It also turned out that I wasn't one of those people. Sure, I knew how to operate a smartphone and Google answers to things, but I had no idea how to build that infrastructure. I hadn't even known how to build a fire when I got sent back here. I would have died of malnutrition and exposure if I hadn't had the gifted curse of invulnerability bestowed on me as part of my wish.

But the thing I'd expected the least when I was transported here is how lonely I would be. There was no one to celebrate with when I finally built a fire and ate cooked fish that I caught myself. There was no one there to cheer me on while I struggled to build a rudimentary shelter. No one to hug for warmth or comfort. No one to complain with.

The harsh reality of my new life had settled firmly over me in a deep deep blanket of loneliness. It was going to be a long 100 million years.

But I knew that when I finally lived my way to modern days, I would treasure it so much more.
