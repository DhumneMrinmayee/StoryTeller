Well, your day just took a bizarre turn.

Your dog, being the curious golden retriever that he is, probably went digging through your flea market finds from yesterday that you hadn't bothered to put away. That one is on you. But what wasn't on you was not believing the old man who sold you that bottle along with a few other nick-nacks. He went on and on about how he was never able to summon the genie within, but you just wanted the bottle because it looked neat. Regardless, you weren't expecting the old man to be telling the truth, let alone that your dog would figure it out before you did, even if by accident.

You're not mad at him for it, you probably couldn't be trusted with the power of a genie's wishes, especially if this is the type of genie that always turns your wishes against you.

What you *are* slightly annoyed about is the fact that your overly dramatic dog used his first wish to bring you back to the living room. All you did was go check the mail...
