Years have passed since that encounter, yet I never forgot that glossy black fur and razor sharp teeth. Even as a pup he was more intimidating that a wolf is to a stray sheep. I had wondered what those lumps on his shoulders were. Now I knew. Before me, the gates of hades guarded by none other than Cerberus himself. It has been years but I could see the same recognition in his eyes as when I fed him, the souls of those animals seeping into his own, strengthening him. I stood there, frozen in fear. I had seen how powerful those jaws were. I flinch when he approaches me, but instead of an agonising bite I feel his wet nose on my skin, a marvel in this burning land. I hear a sound, like the crying of a soul trapped for eternity. Confusion floods my veins, all blood disappearing from sight. Was this gigantic dog whimpering? I lean in to hug him and I feel the pain, the pain of condemning thousands of souls to the deep void of Tartarus. I hugged him tight, speaking in a soothing voice 
“Everything will be alright, let’s get out of here.”

He runs faster than a blazing wildfire, two lost souls fleeing from the gates of death. We would not be enslaved. They would hunt us like dogs, like men reclaiming a stolen treasure. We would run, but in between the fear you can feel the air in your face and the freedom in your heart.

Two souls on a journey. A never ending journey of freedom.
