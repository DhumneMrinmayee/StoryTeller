This actually kinda how I met my boyfriend. I was at my local mead hall talking to my friend (the owner) and was talking about my upcoming joint birthday party at that very mead hall with another friend (we don't share a birthday but they're really close together). The guy next to me asked when my birthday was. Turns out he had the same birthday as me. So we invited him to invite friends to the party and celebrate with us. We had a great party and became fast friends. We've been together 2 1/2 years and now we're both lying in bed scrolling through Reddit. I love sharing a birthday with my person.
