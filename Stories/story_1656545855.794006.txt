The reporters always, ALWAYS, asked how I'd gotten my super powers, and I always told them I just didn't know. I could focus on things with my eyes, and the lasers would come out and destroy whatever they were looking at. It all happened so fast no one could even see it.

But the cats. Oh God. The cats. They were so fast. And so many. And they HAD to attack the red dots...
