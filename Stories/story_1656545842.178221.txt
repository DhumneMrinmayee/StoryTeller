(I'm not very good at this so forgive my lack of quality)

Initially, the reaction was as you'd expect.

"Monster, get away from him!"

I knew it was coming, people have no love of "my kind". People nearby looked at me with disdain after that. However, desperation pushes people to points they would never stoop to otherwise.

"Please, I beg you. I can't lose him."

I simply nodded, and approached the victim. From what I gathered he fought off a thief attempting to steal the valuables of him and his wife. He succeeded, but was fatally injured in the process by way of a blade to the lungs.

As I approached, the man stared with fear in his eyes, the labored breathing getting stronger. I cast a simple sleep spell on him and got to work, this won't take long.

I laid my hand upon the wound, giving the victim a shock of pain but not enough to wake him. Focusing, I poured necrotic energy from my fingers into the wound and got to work.

*Many believe Necromancers are all alike, raising the dead and controlling souls to do their bidding.*

Tendrils of energy licked at the wound as I laid my other hand on his chest, waiting for the right moment.

*That's merely one principle however. The truth is, Necromancy is a generalist school. The term itself is a misnomer.*

I felt it, the momentary skipped beat. With that I sprung into action, Necrotic energy surging into the damaged cells as the body itself shut down.

*Necromancy isn't the manipulation of death, no energy exists in death to manipulate. No, we manipulate life. We give life where it no longer exists.*

And the cells revived, the bleeding stopped and the pain was lifted slightly. The wound didn't close as this is not proper healing magic, but the body would repair itself.

"He will live."

*The true name of the school is Vivomancy, Life Magic.*
