But why is it '+3' ?

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a heck of a toothpick. A great big sword called... butterfly something; can't quite recall, but it has the most peculiar glow on it, a soft greenish-blue - perhaps it reminded people of the northern skies at night. But why did they put +3 at the end?  Makes no sense. *Bah*. Either way, here I am, with a massive sword and my regular stock - stuff I actually sell.

Smithing ore and berries.

Perhaps I'm getting old. Or perhaps I'm still too young because this... this is killing me. The monotony of sitting by idly, waiting for people to visit, to spend, while they are out there having the adventures and the glory. *The fun.* 

True - they die. They die often. But it never keeps them down, no, they just come back, stronger, faster, their perseverance not leaving them for nary a moment! When you watch that - that willpower, that drive - how can you be content with just sitting on the sidelines? So you know what?

To hell with this.

This sword - I shan't resell it. I shall make it mine. I shall go out there to meet the giants of old and nightmares of the Abyss. I shall fight them all and die by their hands. I shall come back and try again, and again, and again. I shall rip and tear until it is done. Perhaps I'll even make a trip out of it. I'd quite like to see the Kiln one day. Likely a fever dream, but aim high, I say.

I know my chances are... not high. Truthfully, it's possible I won't even come back upon my untimely demise. But it's better than sitting here, already dead.

I may not be the Chosen Undead.

But I *choose* to go anyway.
