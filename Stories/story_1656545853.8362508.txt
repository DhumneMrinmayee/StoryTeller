You were never the brightest, but you worked hard and did your best, you are a sidekick, you are supposed to give backup  to the hero and help them defeat the dark forces, otherwise the world could be in jeopardy or at least that was what they taught you at the academy, but this! This is f*cking ridiculous,  at this point the villans aren't  even trying to destry de city, none of them seems to have an evil plan that needs stopping, no at this point it is all bickering between  these sad old men. Oh Professor Doomsday, we will destroy the water purification  system, just to prove that Marvel man can't  stop him, you two get there and the two just start arguing about who is the strongest and startest, ends up being you that needs to defuse the goddam bomb, they don't  even jotice when you do or when you left to get coffe.

-fucking hell, everyday this bullshit.

You say changing from costume to your regular clothes and heading out.  You walk from the water purification  plant to the nearst coffee shop,  and sit down, you don't  even have to worry, you know they will be at it for at least half an hour, you complain about how useless  the heros in this town are and a goth looking girl laughs  in return:

- the heros are pathetic, but the villans... you should see them.

-it is basically  a competition  to see who looks better in tight outfits with you underware showing.

She laughs  a little again, a sarcastic laugh

-this city need a real villan

-or a real hero. I reply

-those old ones need to retire

She looks at me with a smirk and a malicious  smile.

-Come with me... she says getting up

-Marvelous Boy. She says close to my ear.

-Wait what? How do you? I mean no, you must be mistaking me for someone else...

-Really  so that is just cosplay sticking out of your backpack 

-what? I pull the backpack  to the front
-Shit! I mean, yeah, it is just cosplay.

-Come on let's  go! Don't  you want to be a hero? 
Again with the malicious  smile... who is this girl? 

She turns going into an allyway.

-hey wait!

I start to run to try and catch on to her. As I turn I see her changing  clothes and putting her mask on.

-What doomsday  Student? 

-oh for the love of god with that pathetic name, just call me Lila.

-get changed I have a plan

-what? No I can't  work with a Villans minion, I will lose my job.

-What job? Running aroud after an narcissistic old man ? You know whay suit yourself 'Marvelous boy' but I am going... 

She finishes dressing while I hold my colorful  suit in hand. 
-Fuck! I need to stop her.

I dress up as quickly as possible. And jump after her... well one of my powers is to be superfast.  So after a few seconds I catch up.

-hey?

-decided to joing me ? 

-No I am here to stop you

-You? She looks me top to bottom and lets a slight laugh slip.

- what? 

-You can try. She smiles 

I start punching and she starts dodging whist still moving forward, I follow trying to stop her.

I try a punch in the right and she blocks it

-What are you fighting for here, exactly?

-What? I am stopping  evil!

I punch  on the left and she blocks me again

-what is evil? I pre conceived  notion that you have been taught, by a bunch of self-righteous narcissistic  old men, that truly belive society wouldn't  be able to sustain  itself without.

-I mean they get a little annoying sometimes, but they mean well

-do they ? Or are they so empty on the inside that they need to create this belief  system in which they are the center. Oh we are needed, we are useful, we are loved and worshiped. 

I try and try to hit her and ignore her words...

-speechless? You have been around them for so long how can't  you see, that at this point they do more harm than good, none of them is actually trying to fulfill  anything, they fight for the sake of fighting. To uphold and protect  ideals that exist only in their minds.

-Shut up! 

I am superfast how can she block all my moves.

-they are all trying to cling to their glory days, that have vanished  and been gone for so long now. 

- they care and want to protect people? 

-do you really  belive that, then what were you complaining  about in the cafeteria.

Finaly and opening I will finaly hit her, right there I prepare the punch and throw  it, I thing I am going to hit her but then...

-So predictable. 

She turns an says, it was a trap, but its too late now, she grabs my arm and pins me to the floor, 

-Come on kid, I thought you of all people would understand. No one care anymore, no one wants to destroy  the world. Not even the villans have a goal anymore, all I even get to do is  whine about losing, and complain about how it is the new generation's  fault that villans aren't  feared how they used to. They are exactly  what you called them, a bunch  of bickering old men. 

I struggle  to admit, but I know she is right..

-wait I never said that!

-Yeah I can read or thoughts, it is one of my powers and you are not as fast as you think you are. C mon I have been stalking  you for weeks  after seeing you at the South  Garden metropolitan, because I knew  you would make a good partner. 

-Wait what?  You can't  just stalk people that is wrong and..

-creepy, I know. Are ypu commign with me or not?

-  sure I guess. The world would be better off without  villans and heros 

-Great let's  go retire those old men.
