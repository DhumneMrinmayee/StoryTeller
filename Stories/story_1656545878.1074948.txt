Day 1 - new world

&amp;#x200B;

Picking Ark Survival Evolved was probably not the best choice but I couldn’t stop myself. When I first loaded up the game and stepped into this beautiful world I couldn’t help but be in awe. I was careful and only spent around half an hour in the world before retreating back into my bedroom. I chose of course to spawn in the safest areas of the island and there were only calm herbivorous dinosaurs. I didn’t venture far and didn’t actually see any dinosaurs. I only saw a dodo and even that was a new experience. Its feathers were so soft and it snuggled up to me. I had come into the island expecting a gruesome reality but I was brought to tears at the contradicting innocence of such a creature.

Day 2 - Tame Master

&amp;#x200B;

I marked my room on the map and gathered any supplies that I had in my room. I set out into the fresh world. I crafted a spear first in order to protect myself. I am surprisingly able to use the gem on my wrist to store items and upgrade skills.  Previously while playing the game I would have used my fists to harvest wood but  those abilities don’t seem to have transferred to me. I had to improvise and use a stone to harvest those materials. I felt much safer with something to protect myself. I hunted dodos for meat. I felt guilty about it but I had no choice. Ending a life for the first time made me gag and I would have vomited if my stomach had not already been empty.I discovered other dodos along the shore line and tamed them as well. In the end I had tamed 7 dodos. I also created a fire.  My body was not used to all this moving in the rough terrain of ark and took a break for the rest of the day.

Day 3 - Parasaur

&amp;#x200B;

Today I felt more ambitious after my taming expedition and set out to tame a parasaur. I feel that I needed to expand the region I could travel on and having a parasaur would allow me to travel further and faster than on foot. I found a green colored one and was able to corner it before using a slingshot to knock it unconscious and tame it. I am calling the parasaur Donald after Donald Duck who also has a bill. I know I'm so creative.  was also able to craft its saddle from the hide of other dodos I found in the area.It was so much faster than on foot and I enjoyed myself greatly. I have started exploring the surrounding area for possible base locations to build a more permanent shelter to better protect me from the elements and potential creatures.

Day 6 - Disaster

&amp;#x200B;

I have terrible news on day 4 Donald died. I got a little too reckless and explored way farther than we ever had before. We were ambushed by a trio of raptors.I wouldn’t have escaped if it hadn't been for Donald. He charged in and protected me. His screams of pain still haunt my dreams. Not a day goes by where I don’t regret my decision. I spent the next 2 days in a depressive episode. This world had given me so much happiness only to rip it from my hands in the next moment.On this day I felt better and managed to tame another parasaur. It was a female and I called her Daisy because she was in a patch of flowers that looked very similar to daisies when I first stumbled upon her. I vow to protect her with my life. We have also begun searching for a suitable base location.Tame another parasaur call him look for base far awayDay 8 - HomeI found a base location that I liked. It's on high ground as is sake from most predators and if one’s there I can see them from a mile away. I have begun building my base as well. It's a simple thatch hut but it’s all I need. Thick calluses have begun to form on my hands. I have a small Dodo farm where I farm their eggs. I also went on a bit of a dino taming spree and tamed 4 Dilos and a Triceratops! The dilos are called Lexi, Parker, Marco, and Dennis. I named the trike Mike and he is a tank, he is gigantic and does all of the heavy lifting. I got blinded by taming the dilos but I recovered in half an hour after washing my face with water. Don’t get me started on Mike. It took me 3 hours to collect enough berries to tame him and he consumes at least 5 times that amount per day. On the bright side, I have a lot of fertiliser to use in the future.

Day 10 - Vengeance

&amp;#x200B;

I did it. I thought I was over it but I wasn't. I went back to the location where Donald had been killed.  It wasn’t the best decision and maybe I should have tamed them instead but I had to avenge Donald. There would also be other opportunities to tame raptors in the future. When I crafted my bow I made as many arrows and as many spears as I could. I also armed all my tames with their respective food which was either berries or meat.  The raptors were by an old ruin. It was a hard battle and Dennis and Lexi are heavily injured but the raptor meat is doing wonders for their wounds. I’m just glad no one was killed. I celebrated with Raptor meat and extra berries for the dodos and Mike. I plan to eventually reach the higher tiers and discover how I was able to be transported to this world as well as the truth about ark. Right now exhausted after my day I sit outside my hut I feel that the crackling fire and starry night sky is all I need
