"Well..." The photographer started, "I guess the shot has to be a pretty clean one. Solid and appreciable, but gets heads turning at them." 

&amp;#x200B;

The Hitman nodded accordingly, but quickly followed up with a remark of his own. "I agree completely with you, a shot has to be clean, otherwise it'll just get messy make everyone think you're an amateur at your job."

&amp;#x200B;

"Well." Another man butted in, slightly slurring his words. "I don't care if the shot is clean or messy, everyone has their own tastes, however it has to be potent, with unmistakeable  evidence that the concocter knows his tastes and knows his shot."

&amp;#x200B;

The Hitman frowned at his comment, "Why on earth would you want people to know you made the shot, I'm more a 'out of sight' guy."

&amp;#x200B;

"Noble," Noted the photographer, "But I must admit that I too want my name plastered all over my work. It gives me great pride to know that other people know me." The alcoholic laughed with him slapped him on that back.

&amp;#x200B;

"That's the way to do it!" The two of them started talking happily about their favourite types of shots and their own, excluding the Hitman.

'*These guys are sociopaths*.' Thought the Hitman, but returned to his drink nonetheless.
