In a world full of super powers and super heroes passive abilities are often ridiculed and made fun of barely any passive abilities are respected or wanted the few exceptions to this are regeneration, reincarnation, invincibility, ricochet (any damage done to you doesn’t affect you but hits the person that did the attack at double the force), and energy store which is part passive part activation (any damage done to you is stored till you, at a later time, chose to let it out doing the same amount damage done to you to anyone you touch) but besides these few passive powers none of the others are respected and people with those powers are considered weak and useless other than for task the strong deem above them, well that’s all except me of course.

My name is… well I technically don’t have a name. My power makes it so anyone within a certain area of me becomes paralyzed with fear, one look from me makes any man cower, as soon as I enter the room everyone is silent all this because of a passive power, which are considered the weakest powers, and to be frank it’s quite lonely I’ve got no friends, family, I haven’t had a actual conversation my whole life and I hate it but my power is always active, and it doesn’t help that I have a demon horn coming out of the left side of my head.

Having the Demon’s Presence, it’s the name I gave my power, is a blessing and a curse like I’ve said I can’t even walk the street without people running from me but because of it I’ve never been robed, shot, stabbed, or even had powers used on me which really only Ricochet or Metal-Head can boast (Metal-Head is the only recorded case of invincibility and Ricochet
The only recorded case of the ricochet power). With my Demon’s Presence I even terrify the strongest listed superhero to the point where he actually fled the fight he scheduled to have with me.

Even the thought of living their entire life alone terrifies most people but I’ve gotten use to it just like I’ve gotten use to the looks of pure horror as soon as I enter a building and the mutterings of “Ah shit it’s The Left Horn” and “It seems The Devil has come” which is understandable I guess given my power along with my horn people could only assume I’m a demon or a devil in fact The Left horn and The Devil have become my actual, and first names I’ve ever had.
