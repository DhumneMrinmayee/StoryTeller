**TAISY**

From my vantage point floating above the castle, I could see the party was underway. The King had spared no expense for the christening of his long-awaited firstborn, Princess Ruena.

Word around the villages was that the baby girl was perfect in every way. Beautiful, with a mild temper and a happy disposition, especially for a newborn. It was rumored that everyone who met her, instantly became enamored. And that was before the christening and fairy blessings that were to be bestowed by the three fairies actually invited to this shindig.

Of which, I was not. The King, or King-Rat, as I’d started calling him when my invite never arrived, had lied to me.

It was well known that our fairy laws limited the number of gifts for royal children to three. Necessitating that only three fairies were allowed to attend an occasion such as a christening.

However, it was also true among our kind that there must always be a counterbalance to the gifts bestowed lest a royal family be given too much and turn spoiled.

And so, fairy law demanded that the offended, uninvited fairy, namely me, again, crash the party and curse the child. Which the King-Rat knew, he knew, and still he had chosen me to be the one, out of the four fairies in the kingdom, to leave out.

Despite the promise made last year when he and the Queen approached me for help conceiving. He had sworn then that I would be invited to the christening. It had been my only condition. After all, I was tired of being the big bad in this Kingdom’s histories, having been excluded from the last ten royal christenings. I mean, being the mandated evil fairy in a kingdom doesn’t exactly do wonders for one’s social life and I was sick of it.

But here I was again, looking down at the party I wasn’t invited to as my wings fluttered faster than a hummingbird’s, keeping me high in the sky. From here, I could see that Hyndra and Peona had finished their blessings, and Boros was approaching the princess. I scoffed, that buffoon had no imagination or any real talent to pull off a blessing worthy of a royal, what a waste.

I sighed, debating my choices. I’d already exhausted my more creative ideas on previous generations, things like color blindness, hemorrhoids from the age of twenty, or my personal favorite an allergy to flowers that instantly caused uncontrollable giggles. But it was against the law to repeat a curse and frankly, the King-Rat deserved the best I had considering he had broken his troth.

Seeing Boros flit away from the babe, I clapped my hands and instantly the sky became dark, forks of lighting sliced through the ominous clouds. If I had to do this, might as well do it right. Showtime.

I flew down towards the royal cradle with a gleeful cackle and a billow of red and black smoke churning around me. Only semi-enjoying the panic and instant stampede of the royal courtiers fleeing from me, as palace guards rushed towards me and surrounded the King, Queen, and Princess.

I slowed my descent and gracefully stepped onto the stone floor in front of the royals.

“You know how this goes, King-Rat.”

“Please, my wife –”

“Going to throw your Queen under the bus too? Not enough to tell a lie?”

The King shot a nervous glance to his wife, and the Queen stepped forward. “Taisy, your heart for others is revered and your curses are always gentle. It was out of respect for you, and a kindness to our Ruena, that we chose you to curse our heir.”

Her words arrested my building rage, my rampage cut short.

Respect? A kindness? I considered the Queen, scenting for any deceit in her words, but found none. She smiled and softened her voice, “May I have the honor of presenting our daughter, Princess Ruena Taisy the First, of the House of Ashren.”

My eyes teared up as I approached the golden cradle, encrusted with jewels and pearls, intricately carved with the story of the fairies and their aid to the humans when they’d long ago discovered and settled these lands.

When I peered over and laid eyes on her, I couldn’t help it, I gasped in awe.

Princess Ruena Taisy the First was breathtaking. Ten little toes and ten little fingers wiggled at me as she smiled, I swear, honest to goodness, smiled at me.

“Hey there, little one.” Her answering coo melted the rest of my heart and just like that I was as enamored with the princess as everyone else was.

But still, the matter at hand demanded resolution. A curse was owed. And her father had lied to me.

“I curse you, little Princess Ruena Taisy, to always know when someone is lying to you, instantly. You will never be caught blindsided by the truth; you will never fall for a trick or a plan against you or your people, you will never have your heart broken because you will always see people for who they are as soon as they speak.”

A sigh of relief and gratitude came from the Queen. She even had the audacity to touch my hand in thanks. I shrugged it off. The King was still fidgeting, nervous, good. They had lied to me. Even if their intentions had been … flattering and somewhat acceptable … I was still unhappy with them, and they deserved to know why. Reaching out my hand, the sweet baby girl grasped a finger in her little clenched hand, and I spoke soothingly.

“My little princess. If your parents only knew what blessings I was preparing to give you, if they’d kept their word and invited me, they’d be weeping right now. I’ve had generations to dream up the best gifts to give all wrapped up as one, but instead the law of the curse forces my hand. This is all I can give you and you won’t always thank me for it. Seeing the deception all around you will harden your heart, make your circle of trusted confidants and friends so small that many days it will just be you, with even your parents outside your trust.”

The Queen, rightfully, was weeping now. The King’s face drained of all color as he held his wife upright by the shoulders. I ignored them, satisfied they understood, and continued speaking to my namesake.

“But it will also strengthen you. Your leadership and your own choices will be governed by the desire to reward honesty and live justly. And in time, your steadfastness may change the hearts of others to do the same. And when you and I strike a deal about your heir’s christening guest list, my princess, you will hear the truth when I tell you that I would treasure an invite. You will know without a doubt how much I would love one day to have the honor of being a fairy godmother in full, granted all the rights and permission to use my skills to enhance and guide a young life.” Unable to utter the words I really wished to say, prohibited by my part as the bad fairy, instead I whispered the opposite of my heart’s wish for the child. “Until then, my little one, be cursed.”

With a final look into those bright eyes and that cherub face, I turned back to the King and Queen. Before they could voice the too-little-too-late apology I saw rising within them, I held up my hand.

“Making her my namesake does not negate that you have relegated me to be her fairy foe instead of fairy godmother. I will never forgive either of you for that. She will be your only child. Let’s hope, for your future grandchild’s sake, she is more honorable than either of you.”

With a withering glance at my fairy counterparts, I launched into the sky before my smile could shine through. I had a namesake! And she is the most perfect baby in the whole world!
