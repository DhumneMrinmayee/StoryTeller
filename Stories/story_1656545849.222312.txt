**Grand Artifacts of the Ages and Cheese!**

“Look who it is. If it ain't the old wise geezer from the cheese wheel shop.” The elf announced.

“Hahaha, you flatter me much, sir Duncan. But you know that you are much older and wiser than me despite your youthful look.” Lucas rubbed the back of his head humbly.

“Oh, we have a newcomer it seems.” Frishta, a young red-haired lady with full plating welcomed him. “Though aren’t you a bit out of your time to go on adventuring?”

“Nonsense!” Sir Duncan protested as he put an arm around his neck. “Ol’ Lucas right here has seen legends come and go through his shop, we could use his expertise on our journey.”

“His cheese wheel shop?” Frishta doubted.

“The very best in all Greathiem!” He proclaimed as he kissed two of his finger as to show its excellence.

Frishta let out a sigh of disappointment. “Well, since we are all here, I think we all owe each other an introduction.”

“I am Frishta Carial, the second-in-hand knight of the Carial house. I will be the leader of this endeavor.” She started.

“I am Duncan Elmish, an ex-convict, much apologies in advance. However, I have decided to turn a new leaf by adventuring and donate half of my winnings to the empire’s treasury as an act of good faith.” Duncan announced dramatically as he fawned all over himself.

Frishta rolled her eyes in response.

“I am Lucas Bob. I am a … cheese wheel merchant. I have decided to experience the thrill of adventuring after sir Ducan politely invited me to join him.”

Sir Duncan gave him a dumbfounded thumbs up as Frishta put her hand over her face to hide her shame.

The last guy in the group was a much larger individual, an ogre in fact. Yet when his turn came he failed to do as much as uttering a single word, but he did grunt if you could count that.

“Oh, this is Yolk. He is not much of a speaker, but he gets the job done.” Frishta explained.

Yolk affirmed her by a loud grunt, or perhaps it was just his stomach telling him it was time for lunch.

“All right if that is all then we …”

Yolk once again grunted, but this time with no chance of being caused by hunger as he pointed toward the large bag Lucas was carrying behind his back.”

“Oh, this thing here. Well, I had some items lying around the shop from when I used to bargain with heroes. Thought, I might bring some with me just to be prepared.”

“I have to agree with, Yolk. It is much redundant to bring that much with you on such a long journey. You are gonna have to drop it off one way or another.” Frishta pointed out.

“Nonsense.” Sir Duncan once again intervened. “This old-timer right here has shoulders with the foundation of a castle. He could probably carry a damn ogre if it came down to it, no offense meant Yolk.”

Once again Frishta let out a sigh, but this time out of annoyance.

“Fine. But be warned. Those who can’t carry their weight are left behind.”

“I will take those words as face value, Ma’am.”

“It is Dame, actually. And you better remember that. Now let's get a move on before dusk sets in.”

And with that being said, the four of our adventures have set out on their journey, unbeknownst to them that the most powerful artifacts in all of Greatheim were already in the cheese wheel merchant’s bag.
