*Clay sat in his Nior-esque office, profoundly bored out of his mind. Not even the repetitious bouncing of his old burgundy rubber ball off the wall near the door to his office, could occupy his time. To say the very least, and pun* fully *intended, work had hit a rather pronounced "dry spell" lately. Not all were quite ready to hire out the professional services of a skilled necromancer, and animator. Probably the most bothersome thing about the latter title is how many people at bars follow up learning this knowledge by asking what studio he drew for.*

"No cases, for almost 25 days." *He grumbled to himself, amidst the procession of his bouncing ball and the slow squeak emitted by the metallic blades attached to the dying ceiling-fan above him.* "Oh sure. I'll be a riot at parties they said. I bet you 5-bucks I could raise my mom from the grave, tell her what I've been up to, and she'd laugh."

&amp;#x200B;

*One last aggressive bounce, caused the ball to go off target and breath the rythem. The ball ricocheted off several filing cabinets, before eventually coming to rest near the old umbrella stand that once belonged to his grandfather.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Without much warning, the door to his office opened, catching his attention. He pulled his propped legs off his desk, and sat upward to strike a much more professional posture. In through the door, was a quite tired and frustrated older man. Clay always did think that this old detective was old enough to possibly have even used the very office he now worked out of. The man even rocked that old brown long-coat and fedora look right out of every private-eye film he'd ever seen.*

"Detective Holiday, to what do I owe the visit?" *Clay greeted.*

*Detective John Murphy Holiday was a man that was circling the drain that was the end of his career. He was near 60 years old, had been shot and stabbed multiple times, and had more lingering injuries than a seasoned rugby player. Oh how the mighty had fallen, he'd often think. Holiday looked around Clay's office. On one wall were what to him appeared to be mockeries of traditional diplomas and certificates of certification. In slang, they were called "sheep's-skin". In practice, Holiday wasn't entirely convinced that wasn't exactly what they were within their frames. Resting on another wall were an array of various sacrificial daggers, candles, charms, trinkets, and relics. Voodoo-shit, Holiday regarded it all as. Behind Clay himself, was a rather large cloth and leather tome. Nothing quite spelled "I played fantasy-based role-playing-games in college" than that book to Holiday. He resented each passing moment in this room. It gave him the creeps. Give him murderers that'll feed you feet first into a wood-chipper any day.*

*Then there was clay himself. He looked as if he could've stepped out of one of those old-timey pictures of Teddy Roosevelt. He wore a white button up shirt with dark leather vest, silver-watch chain, matching slacks paired to the vest, and a pair of those glasses that were just lenses connected and fixed to his face with bits of gold wire. Clay wore his black hair slicked back, and neat. Shorter on the sides.*

"You know damn well why I'm here." *Holiday bellowed with a gruff raspy voice of a man who'd smoked before he hit double digits in age.* "We got a fresh one - so to speak. Death with suspicious circumstances. CSI boys can't figure it out. Case is about to go to trial, and the suspect has the potential to walk away with all the cheddar. Tune of 47 Million dollars."

*As if purely for comedic effect, Clay's glasses slid down his nose*. "Well, blimey."

"Yeah Blimey is right. Look, DA wants this done, wrapped up with a neat little bow so we can all go home and put this to rest. We need to know if her death was a murder or an accident. Or even suicide."

*Clay clapped his hands, and rapidly ascended to his feet.* "To the hearse!" *The Englishman exclaimed. Holiday rolled his eyes.*

"Look, you'll get double your normal rate, and I'll even toss ya a couple extra bucks for your trouble. I know its been slow. Just...ease up a bit. I ain't got time for no bouncing business."

*Clay gathered his own long coat, and the large tome behind his desk. He rummaged around the trinkets, and pulled down a triangular silver pendant, and put it around his neck.* "Excellent. Then you've secured my services. I pray they didn't exhume the body this time?"

"No. We're cops, but we're not idiots. We know the rules. Judge gave us one night to get this done, otherwise the trial starts Monday. If this guy's a murderer, we'll know it and really nail 'em. If it's an accident, then he gets paid. If it's suicide, well, that's just tragic all around. Hope that ain't the case. She was a sweet girl."

"Well I'm sure we'll find out. Interesting thing, reanimation. I'm sure you know that it is impossible for a corpse risen for reanimation to lie. Honestly, with more people like me around, think how fast one could do away with the old courts! So efficient!"

*Holiday grasped the office's door, and pulled it closed. He watched Clay bound past him and around the corner for the stairs.* "Or invent more thoughtful killers smart enough to destroy a body. Oi Gevalt."
