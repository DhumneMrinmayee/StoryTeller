We are the Protectors. A unit of supernaturals and humans paired together to track down and stop lame 'hunters' from causing harm.  I am Axe Fritz, one of the strongest and not to brag, but quite charming vampires you could meet. My partner River Hart, Is the lucky human to be paired up with me.

Quite honesty I wasn't sure what to expect when they said we'd be getting a human partner, we were supposed to be hidden, unknown, but apparently these humans were either reformed hunters or people who just happened to catch a supernatural as a bad time and figured them out. 

They were given an option to have their memory wiped about our existence, or to swear an oath of secrecy and join this gov assignment, or whatever.

But River turned out to be super cool, They were fun and chill. They explained to me that had crashed at a friend's place after getting wasted at a part and ended up walking in on them shapeshifting. River learned they were a Fairy and often used shapeshifting spells to hide their wings and such, but as it was uncomfortable, they would revert to their form back home, unfortunately, they forgot that River had crashed at theirs last night. That story had me wheezing on the ground, It was probably a good half hour before my laughter died down.

Working with River was the best, we made a great team, they always seemed to know how to talk to people, get them to calm down and listen, that is if they would let them talk, often enough I would half to... persuade them to listen, It's funny how fast they go from 'big tough hunter' to a whiney snivelling baby.
