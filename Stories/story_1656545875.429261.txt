While I scream "AH DAWNT SKARE" on my mic to my dwindling audience, I browsed the internet to see who does the polls. It turns out it's my own blood enemy: the man named Moon on Wiki Mines.

So then I decided to hunt for the man named Moon, track him down in Serbia and then we finally meet at an abandoned warehouse in Kosovo.

"Good morning, TRR! I didn't expect you to fly all the way from Richmond just to kill me."  said Moon in his voice that only a person with fried vocal chords can have.

"Skrew yew muffugger! Why did yew tern yer back on meh?" I bellowed.

"Just like I always say..." said Moon and then two gunshots echoed in the air. I then found myself on the ground, my life slipping away from me.

"You're just a pawn in the game". Moon continued as I lay down on the ground , blood seeping out of the two holes at the back of my head.
