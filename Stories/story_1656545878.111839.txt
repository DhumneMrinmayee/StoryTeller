This is a real shite situation, ain’t it?
…
Alrighty, let’s assess the options. Destiny would be mostly fine if I spawn in the tower, but if I don’t I’m fucked. Hitman just seems like a bad plan on principle. Jedi fallen order is a hard no. Same with Titanfall. Don’t even want to THINK about Monster Hunter. Not doing The Division, I’ve already been though a pandemic once and I don’t need another that has rioters. HELL NO I’m not doing God of War. Shadow of Mordor has plenty of edible things, but unfortunately I would be one of them, so that isn’t ideal. Black Ops 3…? I suppose if I just snag an abandoned house in the country, I’ll be fine… and they still have food in the technofuture, so I’m golden if I just stay away from any explosions, cities, and familiar-looking countries. Yeah. This’ll go great.
