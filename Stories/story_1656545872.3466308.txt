An all too common mistake people make is believing imprisonment automatically equates to evil. Imprisonment is simply the powerful exerting their will on the weak. The powerful bend the truth to their will to make their opposition seem the enemy. On occasion, those imprisoned deserve to be there, but not always.  
  
You mean to set forth a doomsday deity upon this world, why? Because you believe this world to be beyond saving. It is a world of inequality and hate, or war and strife, of loss and pain. Have you asked yourself what kind of gods would allow the world to become such a place?  
  
You sought out a god to aid you, because you do not understand the role they play in this. It is just as in the mortal world, the gods are no better than us. The powerful exert their influence on the weak, and silence opposition. I am that opposition.  
  
While the powerful, evil gods made playthings of mortals, watching them fight and suffer, I imagined a better life for them. The gods whispered to their priests to outlaw gods which did not align with their beliefs within the cities they had control of, for as these gods and churches grew more powerful they gained more and more influence.  
  
My numbers dwindled. Believers only worshipped me in secret. I became a taboo name, one whispered amongst occult circles. They forgot what I was meant to symbolize, and superimposed their own dark wishes upon me. These are the events that led you to summon me today.  
  
You are not wrong about my power. I do bring violence and change, but not in the form of doomsday. I bring revolution.
