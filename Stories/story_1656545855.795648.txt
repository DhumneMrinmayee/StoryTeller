“It’s just an illusion.” I’ve said it hundreds of times. The silly girl won’t believe me.

“It feels REAL! It has to be! PLEASE! I don’t care if it hurts, send me back!” It hasn’t ceased for hours…

I sent her to an alternate reality in an attempt to ease her suffering. Two versions of the same soul can’t exist within a single reality. It’s painful. But usually, people get a feeling of closure… like it’s a dream…

Cause I say it IS a dream.

Apparently she wants to just stay in that dream…

I can’t let her do that though…
