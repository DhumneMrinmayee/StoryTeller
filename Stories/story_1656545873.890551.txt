“My, my, my, little girl. How futile of you. Have you ever learned of the etymology of the word Man?”

“Um… what do you mean? What are you doing?

“How brave of you. Let me teach you a lesson before you die. The word Man comes from the Proto-Germanic word *mann*, meaning person, with the prefixes *wer* and *wif* referring to male and female respectively. Had you known that the prophecy had been made before the cultural shift away from this, you may have stood more of a chance. But now you must die. Relish in the fact that the last minutes of your puny planet were filled with learning for the futile self-proclaimed *hero* the people all placed their hopes on before their demise.”

“Well… Well, you still can’t win! The AI, which is not a person, is primed and ready to launch all its nukes at you and defeat you as soon as you try to leave, leaving you defeated at the hands of no Man!”

“And the fallout from the nukes will render your planet uninhabitable for you puny humans. Even if I am to die, my work will still be done. Now say goodbye.”

“No! Never!

“Oh well. Your loss.”
