His eyes blinked open and he smiled. He reached with his feet to find his slippers and carefully  made his way to the bath in the dark. The match scratched to a flame and he leaned over to light the small pieces of wood below the tub. The fire flickered enough light to see the faucet and he flicked his wrist causing the water to pour out and fill the tub. He smirked and pushed the match box into the trash, "Won't be needing these anymore". 

Her eyes blinked open with a smile and her hand waved to ignite her bedside candelabra. She fluttered down the hall into the bath and waved at the tub. The sticks burst into a small yellow flame. She began pumping the water into the tub and cupped her hand under the spout. How exciting to be chosen to teach the Grandmaster of Water about fire magic. She shivered with excitement and wondered what kind of student he would be.
