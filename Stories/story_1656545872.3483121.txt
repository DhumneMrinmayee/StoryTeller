As the ritual nears completion, a plume of dark smoke and... bubbles? billows out. As the deity materializes,  the cult leader bows deeply while his followers exchange quizzical looks.

"Is our saviour SUPPOSED to smell like roses?"
"I was told we were summoning a destroyer!"

As the cloud clears, a beautiful goddess is revealed. She smiles sweetly and says,

"Oh, I assure you that I hold FAR more power than the one many of you thought you were drawing into your world."

At these words, the bowing figure straightens himself and welcomes the goddess to which he has devoted his entire life.

"Oh, great Aphrodite, thank you for heeding our call. I eagerly await your destructive power." He bows deeply once again and lays a sacrifice of apples at Aphrodite's golden-sandaled feet.

"Are you sure you know what you are asking for?" Aphrodite questions her devotee. "The apocalypse I will bring about will be torture for followers and nonbelievers alike for many generations to come."

"I am aware."
