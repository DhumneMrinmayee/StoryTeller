I pace, and I think. I pace and think for hours, trying to find a way to curse the child without harming them. I know the king simply forgot. He is an idiot of epic proportions. Then the idea strikes me suddenly, like a flash of lightning lighting up a dim room.


The party was the following morning. Sneaking in was easy for a shape-shifting fea like me, I just took the form of a bird and flew right into the throne room. No one even questioned why a bird was in the castle. As soon as the hush started to begin the ceremony, I jumped in front of everyone and revealed my presence in a dramatic explosion of feathers and lights.

"You, king Falle of the Accan Kingdom! You forgot to invite me to this party, and thus I must place an unbreakable curse upon your child. The other option is for our kingdoms to go to war!" I recited my practiced speech for all to hear. Before any could protest, I approached the child in the nurse's hands and waved my wand. The curse was ready. 

"I curse this child to always spill or drop anything her father asks her to pass at the dinner table right onto him, and to sneeze loudly during any quiet moment in any important event."

Three, two, one...

"AAACHOOO!" the infant roared. My work done, I went home. Falle would certainly be more inconvenienced than the princess, but technically, I'd upheld my duty.
