The machine, the cold, calculating system of ones and zeros had logiced itself to a more humane solution than we ever could.

I slumped into the chair, wracking my tumbling assessment of both myself and my species for something to say - some, "but we...." retort that would convince it -

'Convince it to **what**, exactly?' I interrupted myself.

I shook my head and looked at the articulated camera array, "So, what do these improvements look like?"

"That's the beauty of it. There's really not a lot for me to do beside rescue a sampling of infants and continue to work on the weapons systems you designed me to perfect. You'll do most of the work yourselves. Eggs.... omelettes."

I thought I heard it laugh, but that couldn't be, could it?
