Ah, emotions… an unusual quirk of evolution which has allowed many species to survive. Whether it’s the knowledge that you could never take on a bear in a fist fight, or helping you pick which equally disgusting coffee you should take to not feel horrible.

But sometimes, these emotions can overwhelm us. Chances are, your decision making abilities have been (or currently is) compromised because a negative emotion has taken over your mind. Like an indescribable monster from the pages of H.P Lovecraft.

We may not have the solution to your problems, but luckily for your problems, we sure do have a way to make them feel tiny. Introducing: the Eldritch-nator program.

Here on a planet your scientists haven’t found yet, we have a mortal being just like you. Sure his organs are all on the outside, and he isn’t even part of the dominating species. But he sure is paralyzed by the very same emotions as you.

Well after taking part in our program, all of that description goes into the past tense. Our dear friend has not only become strong enough to take on the galaxy, but has grown so much that he no longer recognizes his planet as a place with other living beings on it.

This distortion of reality might seem concerning to some, but rest assured that 99.12% become to busy pondering the mysteries of the universes to bother with the destruction of mortal life as we know it.
