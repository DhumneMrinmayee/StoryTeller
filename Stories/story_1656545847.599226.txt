"But- but garlic bread. I've seen you eat garlic bread." Jason sputtered. Tamir shrugged, and with her perfect hourglass figure he was a little amazed he had never seen before. 

"Santori's garlic bread. It's worth it." She replied calmly. "I've seen the way you drool over the pizza. You can't fault me." 

Jason placed his head in his hands. "I'm sworn to the brotherhood to kill all the loathsome blood drinking scum-" his voice died out at rhe glare his vampiric roommate shot his way. 

"And my blood oath to wipe you and yours off the planet?" She hissed and pulled her cloak tight around herself. "Even with my ability to compel mortals- no landlord would let the rent slide by that much."

"So... I guess that leaves one question..." Jason looked up as their third room mate, Adam walked from his room, shuffling to the fridge and grabbing a slice of leftover pizza. He bopper his head along to the music on his headphones and mumbled a barely legible 'hey guys' before vanishing back into the bedroom. 

"What do we tell him?"

Tamir rummaged through the cupboard for a foil wrapped pop tart and sat across from Jason with a knowing grin.  "Don't worry about Adam. He's a werewolf."
