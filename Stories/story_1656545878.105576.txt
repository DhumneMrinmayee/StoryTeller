I picked Skyrim, when the alternatives are the Flood, Zombies, or Demons; dragons, bears, and trolls don't seem so bad.  Bad shit only happens when the dragon born is around anyways, so I avoided him like he was the plague mixed with AIDs.  


Before I stepped through the door though, I had to wrack my brain for the safest part of Skyrim, I remember reading somewhere that the dragon born doesn't need to visit Dawnstar for the main quest, so I went with Dawnstar.


I got a job from some NPC to work the farm, they had some questions about my clothes.  I just told them I'm from Cyrodil and trying to make a new life, I think they bought it because they didn't ask more questions, and gave me the job.  


I make 16 gold an hour to till the fields grind wheat, which is enough to keep me stocked on bread, cheese, and milk.  I work for 3 weeks at a time, buy 3 months of food and water, and then hide away in my room until supplies are exhausted, then I go back to work.  I wish I could say I was smart, or observant, or talented, but I've got no fuckin idea why this happened, so I'm just gonna try to not die for a while.  


It's been going well so far though, it's been almost 2 years by my count, and I'm still surviving, thriving even, the hard work has me in better shape than I've ever been, and I finally had time to actually play my video games, which has been nice.  With the capitalist hellscape I was in back home, I struggled to make ends meet, I had rent, utilities, insurance, car payments and now I can be free.  


It's ironic really, I thought life was going to be awful with the new setup, but it's never been so easy for me before.  I even have Wi-Fi so I've been thinking about experimenting with mods.
