   I've gone through this what, 20 or so times? Despite that, I've got only a couple leads as to what's going on here. After some brainstorming, I realized that every single person that I've been has been American. "That's gotta mean something, right?" I thought. But then, after about the 15th day, I noticed. Every one of the people I was worked at some lab in California!

  I got on the newest person's laptop and starting researching. Right as I was about to find the lab though, the laptop shut off. "Damm it!" I was this close to finally getting a major lead! I looked around to see what the problem was, and the moment I looked behind me I saw someone... familiar looking. As if I saw them from one of the earlier days.

   This man said nothing, but gave a stare so intense that he didn't even need to explain that he had a vendetta. I was frozen in my  seat. Should I run and hide, or stay and talk? You know what, it's not like death is permanent anymore. "Why?" He flicked on the lights and I saw that he was wearing a lab coat. In an instant, I remembered who he was. The man with the vendetta was the head scientist. This guy had to have something to do with the case! "Do you know anything about a specific time loop?" "Well, you should know- you were me before." And then he was gone.

   I knew it! I tried to remember what I did as him. I remember taking a stroll through the lab... and seeing what looked like some sort of a reactor! I raced to the lab,  but when I got there, the head scientist was standing at the front door. "If you turn off that reactor, I will make your life a living hell. But, go if you dare." I didn't even think about that and continued my mad dash. Finally, I saw the reactor and switched it off. I was back as my old self... in lab clothes... was I the head scientist?

This is my first real story, so please give feedback!
