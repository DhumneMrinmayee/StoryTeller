"Cullfrog, Cullfrog!"

"Says Cullfrog, Sarge."

"I can see that! What is it?"

"Cullfrog!"

"That's all he says, Sarge, but he won't go away."

"Okay... then what do I call you?"

"Uhh... I think... just Cullfrog, Sarge"

"Cullfrog!"

"Oh. Right. And what do you want... Sir?"

"Cullfrog cullfrog! Cullfrog. FROG! Cull cull, frooogg. Cullfrog. Frog frog, cull?"

"Think he wants to fight with us, Sarge."

"CULL-FROG!!"

"Okay... I... Form up, then. Not going to turn away any able bodied... men. Not in this war."
