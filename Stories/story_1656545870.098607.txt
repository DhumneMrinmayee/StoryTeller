For some reasons a rat is always with us.
May you blossom is the difference between a strat and a rat.
You out there hear my pleas to find the rat who sleeps near my mat.
I do not ask for mercy for me 
As I would have none for him either
I pray to know between his eyes the bullet within his lies.
How can a man wear such colors as our valors.
How can a traitor hides under me as a lover
How can an insect join band with whom would slice his neck.
There is courage to see that a name pays respect.
And there is a chance a false actor may get his jest.
But do fear that our group can find you.
Under the guise of lies you grow.
And under my flow you shall suffer the greatest of foe.
