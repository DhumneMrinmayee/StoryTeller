"What was that old saying? Ah..yes. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade," Dagroth chuckled as he watched the dragon ploughing his field, while his devotees were sowing seeds and performing other tasks.

"Is this really alright?" asked his wife, Grace, looking concerned.

"Well what else could I do? Those fanatic would not leave me alone. They were ready to kill at my command. So I thought why not use them for farm work, since we are anyways short of labor. All the farmhands ran away when Ignis was born."

"Yeah, about him. Are you sure he is safe to be kept around here? His one breath can destroy our entire farm, our house and us."

"He's alright. I have already tried everything I could to get rid of him, but he really thinks of us as his parents. He won't harm us. Look at him go. He's enjoying himself."

"Master Dagroth, I have fed the chickens and the ducks. How else can I serve you now?" asked one of the cloaked devotees.

"You can go and wash the cows now."

The disciple bowed and went on his way.

"They really do everything you say," said Grace, looking quite amused. Dagroth chuckled again.

"Master!" One of the devotees was running up the road towards the farm. "A party of knights is headed this way. About 20 of them."

"Ignis!" Dagroth called out. "Your lunch is here." 

The dragon dropped the lines attached to the ploughs and rose majestically in the air. He knew where his lunch would be, and flew away in that direction.

Dagroth gestured to a group of devotees standing nearby. "You lot, go and assist Ignis. If he gets so much as a scratch, I will have your heads."

They all bowed, grabbed their weapons and ran after the dragon.

"How long do you think, before they realize you are no demon lord and they were just taking orders from a farmer?" Grace asked.

"As long as we have Ignis, they will blindly follow us," Dagroth winked.

"Making lemonade indeed. Let us have lunch too."

They both laughed and went in the house.
