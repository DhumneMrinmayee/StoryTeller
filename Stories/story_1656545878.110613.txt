I had read about this happening before. The local library had started a program where they built mini library stations around the city and one of them was around the corner from my house. Kids and parents would come and go, but I noticed there was a book with no title that would always stay. I sort of felt bad for it so I decided to give it a look.

When I opened my door this morning, there was nothing. The concept of nothing is difficult grasp and there is no way for me to explain it. You would have to experience it to understand. In the book, the video game you play is the world that loads up outside your door. “Great”, I thought, all my gaming consoles were in the non-existent living room. The Sims is probably the safest game I own but risking being kidnapped by an alien, bitten by a werewolf, or killed by the grim reaper is still too dangerous for me. I then remembered about that one day I was feeling nostalgic and bought Cooking Mama. This is what’s going to keep me alive.
