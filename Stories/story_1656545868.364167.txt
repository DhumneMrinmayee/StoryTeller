Well, shit.

I mean in retrospect I guess I should have seen it coming, sort of. Genies have a reputation for twisting wishes in cruel and unusual ways and I let my excitement get the better of me. So here I am, immortal and invincible.

And some 100 million years in the past.

Could be worse I suppose. When I take the time to think about it - and I have nothing but time lately - I could have gotten a lot worse deal. If the Genie sent me to the end of time, I'd have nothing to look forward to. It could have not stopped my ageing, dooming me to become a shrivelled husk. I'm sure there's a lot worse that could have happened.

The view is nice; I get to walk around and look at all the animals and plants palaeontologists would kill for. Sky has no light pollution and I get to look at all the stars clearer than ever. The occasional run-in with a T-Rex only ends up in me being picked up, shaken around a bit and the T-Rex running away with a chipped tooth on account of my now impervious skin - more fun than it sounds actually. Kinda like a rollercoaster with a lot more saliva and giant lizards.

Thing is, humanity will come around eventually and I have to carefully consider what I will do. An obvious first idea is to become some sort of God-Emperor, an invincible leader with knowledge from beyond the ages. Then I considered just being a silent watcher on the sidelines and maybe writing it all down - I've always wondered how much history we got completely wrong.

Maybe I'll just be me. We'll see.

After all, I've got nothing but time to think it over.

Now then - first thing on the bucket list is to see if I can domesticize a velociraptor.
