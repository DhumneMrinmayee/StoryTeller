“Kuri, would you please pass the potatoes.”
Rain tapped the exterior of our house, leaving a peculiar mist on the dining room window. Kuri and I ate our dinner in its presence, trying to enjoy the bit of civility we can grasp until-
Well, you know.
“Last week, it was the FBI. I won’t be surprised if the National Guard is next.” Kuri said while stuffing his face with chicken.
“This house is listed under an alias, a name that is tied to a real person,” I said, and Kuri gave me a look. “They are incapable of making the connection, and we should be free to live as we please.”
Kuri continued to eat his chicken in silence, and after a moment passed, I wiped my hands and walked over to him. 
“Look at me,” I said, and his dark eyes landed on mine.
“As long as we’re together, everything will be okay.”
I moved some stray hairs from his forehead. He closed his eyes and gave me a reluctant smile. The rest of the night went on in that regard, the light rain a gentle drum on our rooftops.
Regret has sunk into my heart and has muddied my spirit ever since. I had no idea that I would be making a promise I wasn’t capable of making - I’ll spend the rest of my life finding out whatever happened to him.
