**Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further research or attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of those items become useful or necessary in the future. -Dr Brimsely 


**Anomalous item #-44273**

**Item Description:** An indestructible cloth woven bag of theoretically infinite internal volume. The inside space is filled with an infinite number of US quarter dollar coins. EVE particle emissions indicate that the bag may have been thaumaturically altered. 

**Date of Recovery:** 06-12-2015

**Location of Recovery:** Vermont, USA 

**Current Status:** In Site-42 low threat anomalous items storage. 

*Notes: On July 24th 2020, Foundation Site-42 fell victim to a Chaos Insurgency attack lead by [LEVEL 4 INFORMATION CLEARANCE NEEDED] The site suffered minor structural damage due to anomalous weaponry used by the group. During the raid several SCP’s, and anomalous items breached containment, or were otherwise stolen by the group.*

*One such stolen item was Item 44273.*

*Item 44273 was later recovered over 3 years later in the Grand Canyon. It is currently unknown how the item came to this location. Upon discovery, the item was upturned, caught upside down, spewing its contents into the Grand Canyon.*

*Of note, Item 44273 was previously stored in low level items storage due a belief that it posed a low threat to normalcy should this item ever be breached. However this incident has proven otherwise.*

*It is unknown how long the item had been upturned, or how long it’s contents had been flowing into the canyon. However it had been evidently long enough for the total amount of reflective material building up In the canyon to be noticed by the Foundation Orbital Spectral Analysis Array (FOSAA).*

*In total, and estimated 3530000000000 Cubic tons of metallic coins had been allowed to accumulate by the time Foundation officials arrived and located the item*. 

*Cleanup and information censorship measures were strained due to the sheer quantity of material needed to be cleared, and the proposal to use Item 44273 itself to fund cleanup efforts was considered, however concerns were raised regarding circulating currency produced by anomalous means, as well as the issue posed by economic inflation*. -Dr Valiskan 

*Notes: Item storage has been moved to medium threat anomalous storage*. -Dr Valiskan 

*Notes: Medium threat? Are you kidding me here?? After all that?? You know how big of a pain in the ass it was to clean all that up? For crying out loud we could see it from space!* -Senior Researcher Morgan

*Notes: Your objections have been noted, and promptly ignored* -Dr Valiskan
