"Guzul?  Is that you?"

"Hey, Kuli.  Good to perceive you.  What are you doing here?"

"Checking out the local eats, like you.  These humans don't know how good they've got it.  Over there, is that ... ?"

"Yeah, that's ol' Reedle.  Wolfing down the usual combo."

"And ... " [pointing across]

"Yup.  Zilzabo.  Looks like they're going for the all-day breakfast this time."

"How many of us are there in here?"

[looks around]  "Probably a dozen or so.  Those two over there appear to be locals, though."

"Doesn't it strike you as a bit weird that it's mostly us in here, and hardly any actual humans?"

[decent imitation of a human shrug] "Honestly, it's probably the only thing keeping most of these places open.  According to the humans, this place isn't particularly good food, but like they say, 'I'm lovin' it'"
