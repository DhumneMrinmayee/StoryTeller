Pappy van winkles. The legend. The rarest bourbon in the world. Amber in the glass. A world on the tongue. A single cube of ice, to just mellow and open the flavors. The alcoholic gazed appreciatively and with a happy noise, tipped the drink into his mouth. He closed his eyes with enjoyment at the sweet burn of the velvety bourbon. A smile came over his face as he swallowed the exquisite liquor. The perfect shot he thought to himself. It was his last thought though because in the next moment a 6.8mm bullet spun its way through his head, exploding out the other side in a fountain of gore. The hitman up in a church clock tower 500 yards away, looked up from his scope. After quickly unscrewing the silencer, and
disassembling his rifle in expertly practiced motions, he headed out of the church. Nobody had even heard anything. Perfect shot, he thought to himself, crossing the street and vanishing into the crowd, but not before photobombing a tourist couple. Later on, the photo went viral as news crews and the police investigation used it to apprehend the hitman. The tourist couple was young and cute and excited to be able to help solve such a terrible crime. “ I was just standing there in front of the church” the girl explained proudly reminiscing “and my boyfriend just took my picture!” They beamed into the news cameras, the lights bright in their eyes. “It was the perfect shot” the boyfriend said and the world agreed.
