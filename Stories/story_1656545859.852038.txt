"Hello and welcome back to the podcast Internet Mysteries! Today's Internet mystery deals with the strange case of u/deleted on Reddit. A controversial user known for commenting on hundreds of thousands of subreddits, u/deleted has been around since the veryÂ beginnings of Reddit. And yet, no one seems to truly know who he or she really are. To get to the bottom of this mystery, I've invited a Reddit admin by the name of John Doe to join me on today's podcast! So, John, what can you tell us about the user, u/deleted? Are they male or female?"

"Uh...I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. U/deleted isn't referring to a single male or female human, it's referring to people--"

"Oh, I see what you're saying. So what you mean is this is a secret organization of hermaphroditic otherkin all secretly using the same username?"

"...What? No, it's not even a real username. It's referring to people who have deleted themselves from Reddit-"

"*gasps* So, what you're really saying is that you're harvesting Reddit users' souls through the Terms of Service and merging them together into a singular hive mind?!"

"...Are you fucking high?"
