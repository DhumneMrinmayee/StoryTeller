I jumped backwards away from the small, fabulously dressed woman with an embarrassingly high-pitched shriek. Grabbing the first thing that came to hand, I pointed it at her.

"What are you doing in my house?"

"I am Akilah, a D'Jinn. I have served 38 masters across more than 3000 years, and now I am bound to serve your faithful pet, oh Master of my Master".

My Labrador, Buddy put his head on one side and watched me carefully.

"Where have you escaped from?", I asked. "Mental hospital? Prison?"

"I have escaped from the bottle that you see there", Akilah said, pointing to the drool-covered bottle that Buddy had helped himself to from my mantlepiece while I was at work. The bottle that I had got when I was on holiday in Jordan.

"Ah. You're a drunk."

Akilah shook her head and frowned in frustration. "No. I was literally in the bottle, not figuratively. I am a Genie."

"Shouldn't you be blue?"

Akilah stamped her foot. "It is only the care my Master has for you stopping me from striking you down. That depiction of my people was as disrespectful as you are slow-witted."

She snapped her fingers, and in a puff of smoke transported herself onto a chair in my lounge to my open-mouthed amazement.

"Now", she said, "if you'll stop waving that plastic bone at me, and listen for a moment, perhaps I can explain. The unfortunate fact is that I need your help."

I looked at the weapon I'd scooped up in my panic, and tossed the squeaky toy in my hand to Buddy.

"Um, are you actually a genie? Or am I having some sort of breakdown?"

"Yes, yes, I'm a genie. I can do more tricks if it will help you skip to the part where you believe me, but we don't have a lot of time."

I licked my lips, and Akilah snapped her fingers again. A cool drink appeared on the counter next to me.

"Uh, thanks?", I said.

"You are welcome, Master of my Master. Are you prepared to listen?"

I took a long gulp of the drink. It was exquisite.

"Mmmmhmm", I said savouring the taste. "Shoot."

"Thank you. I need your help to understand the wishes of your dog."

"Buddy", I said.

"Of Buddy. Yes. There of rules that govern my species, and these rules were written in a....less flexible time. Failure to adhere to the rules is punished by death."

I nodded for her to continue.

"Ah, you're not perturbed by that. I should specify that it is punished by the death of everyone. Everyone involved in the rule-breaking, which in this case would include Buddy, and you as accomplices."

I coughed on my latest sip of the magical drink that the genie that served my dog had zapped out of thin air. "Accomplices to what?"

"A genie can only complete a period of service and return to their rest once we receive and grant 3 wishes. Now, a dog's wishes are simple and easy to grant. They rarely require the careful semantics that granting a human's wishes requires to avoid it damaging the lives of others. They don't ask to rule over people or force someone to want to copulate with them. However, if a wish is not received and granted quickly on release, then the power that governs my people will act. They believe that allowing too much time to plan wishes leads to more evil. If this does not happen, then they will clean up in a very final way."

"OK, so just grant Buddy his wishes then? I'm sure he wants a sausage or some cheese."

"And you know this, do you? You speak dog?"

I frowned, put the drink down and went to the fridge. "No, but I mean, look", I said pulling a cocktail sausage out of the pack I had in the fridge door for Buddy snacks. Buddy immediately ran to me and started to spin around on the spot in excitement. "He loves these."

"Yes, but that's not a wish. He has not said I wish I had a sausage has he?"

I dropped the snack into the waiting hound and had to concede that point. "So what do we do?"

"I need you to accept a wish, and use it to give Buddy the power to communicate with us."

I put my head on one side, as Buddy had earlier. "What, from you?"

"No. I will need to bring in outside adjudication. The rules are very clear on D'jinns using their own powers in this situation. Will you accept?"

I decided it was time to take my hands of the handlebars and just freewheel into whatever form of psychotic break this was. "Yeah, Sure, why not?"
