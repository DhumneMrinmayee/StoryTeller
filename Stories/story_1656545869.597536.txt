Sean couldn't sleep any better here either.

The chatter of the trees had not ended when he had ridden north.  He had seen the statistics sure, but the tenth biggest being this was, well, underwhelming.  As he rode north, he had seen a remarkable amount of trees.

Sean had not been stupid enough to just move out.  No, he had booked a getaway for a few nights to himself.  Out of nature.   Yet when he reached his hotel on first street, he found the road lined with gossiping trees.  Dismayed he walked in to the building, and found that his room had a window out onto the street.  The street with all of those god-forsaken trees.

That night he sent nightmares, or rather, elf-dreams to his booker.  

The next day he wandered the city.  Unable to get away from the ever present nature.  At one point looking off of a freeway bridge.  He could almost see himself as being back in the woods.

Yet, overall, it was nice, Sean thought to himself, they were a lot more quiet than the redwoods he called home, yet next time, maybe he would go to a different city than San Jos√©.

I decided to tackle this as if our elf friend was staying in my city where there are a lot of trees.
