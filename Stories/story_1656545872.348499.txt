"You have arrived too late, nonbelieving fools. Your demise is at hand, for our Lord arises, our Lord arises TO CLEANSE THE WORLD WITH FIRE!" The Cultist Chief screamed, holwing with glee.  The earth began to rumble, and the grizzled detective sighed the resignated sigh of a man who knew full well that he had lost. He withdrew a metal flask from within his waistcoat and took a long draught of liquor, knowing full well that it would be his last before his mind was torn to shreds by the awakened eldritch horror. The ground rumbled as a loud meow echoed through the city and.....

Wait. A meow?

The detective looked up in confusion. The Cultist Chief looked around, equally confused. Now on the hill, looming over the city, was a giant black kitten roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. Its black fur was gorgeous, and the eyes showed a keen intellect and mischeivious disposition. It yawned, revealing a maw that looked significantly more terrifying when scaled up to that scale. 

The Cultist Chief turned to his summoner. 
"What happened? You were meant to summon Cenusa, not a gaint kitten! You IMBECILE!" He screamed, spittle flying from his mouth.
The summonner looked sheepish.


"Sorry, Im dyslexic."
