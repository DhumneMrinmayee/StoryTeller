[poem]
“my friend, you have given me comfort and joy

I hate to watch you as you lay down and fold

Can offer thou a painful transmission?

A mark on neck means endless commissions”

carpenter hisses the heaviest sigh

“read my letter”; he collapses and dies:
~~~
“I have things in my heart I can no longer hide

i say this as my life sets into night

I have known you from the days of my youth

I can’t bare to leave without offering truth

I love you! I LOVE YOU! but love is a sin!

on my deathbed you made feel forever green!

I left you a box under the bed 

use what’s inside and you’ll meet me again”
