Gremlack was pretty sure it had to be the sword. She certainly wasn’t human. Her long, pointed teeth, yellow skin, and protruding ears were proof enough of that. Those ears were the main reason why so many of her kind had died in the war. Getting a proper helm forged had cost her most of her savings, but her life surely made up for that. And if not, finishing the mission would provide due compensation.

“Alright, no sword.” Gremlock drew a dagger, attempting to plunge it into the warlock’s thigh. Still no effect. “Alright, what gives?” Gremlock was curious now; her father’s dagger had been forged by the legendary goblin smith Archad, nothing human about it. 

“It’s simple, you foolish creature!” The warlock was grinning widely now. “A human sent you to kill me. Thus you are the tool of a human and no threat to me. You may as well give up now.”

Now it was Gremlock’s turn to smile. “Alright, the hard way” she grinned, pulling a large net from her bag. She threw the net over the warlock and began dragging them out of the cathedral.

“Was only hired to stop you. Thought killing you was easier, tall folk are heavy.” Despite their struggles, there was nothing the warlock could do. The anti-magic net was quite secure.
