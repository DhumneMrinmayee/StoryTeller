I never thought i'd ever think this but i'm happy i'm mute, if you have to write down every promise you make you have some time to think about them, hence i made very few promises and none that where terribly inconvenient to keep.

I haven't really made a big effort to check if there are more people like me though, i've been busy, and not with shadenfreudian laughing at red-faced politicians toppling backwards mid frantic livestream (though i'll admit i watched a few of the local politicians go down with a smile), no, no i've been busy helping my soon to be husband remember and write down all his dumb promises.

Luckily he's been extremely noncommittal most of his life and most of the promises he made where to me, but whereas he once promised his mom to mow the lawn next Saturday, he promised me more binding things like "i'll always be there for you" and "i'll do everything you need for you" which was heartwarming when i just ended up in a wheelchair, but now was a little more binding, we hadn't even figured out if we could spend time appart without him going belly up.

Well, 22:30, bed time, i did promise i'd keep a more consistent sleep schedule.
