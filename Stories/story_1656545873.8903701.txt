“Fuck you!” I tried again, scowling in frustration as the sword bounced off again. This was not how it should go. Centuries of careful work from my forebears! “long-lived, youthful features beyond normal aging standards, silent tread, high-level genetic drift from Homo sapiens due to the early Asian continental people interbreeding with Denisovans and genetic manipulation to further distance me from mankind! The race that most equates to man would be those with pure Homo sapiens genetics. I even got someone to restore this early hominid weapon in the event that it had to do with the weaponry itself!”

“You’re still only human,” the demon chuckled darkly. Leaning in and grinning viciously. I continued scowling darkly as I lifted my wrist to my mouth.

“Send in Plan B.”

The demon blinked, smile fading into confusion.

“Plan B?” He asked. I nodded.

“If mankind is still born mankind despite being nearly purely a different species, then we’ll see if this works instead.”

There was a shrill noise raising in the air. The demon looked up in time for the silvery humanoid to punch it at just barely the threshold of subsonic speed.

I wiped the blood off my face with a disappointed sigh. The android looked over at me and ran a scan before determining that I was unharmed. It turned to leave to return to its docking station.

“Well, it looks like Plan B worked.”
