\[Poem\]

So this is the story of all about how

King's life got flip turned upside down

And I'd like to take a minute

Just sit right there

I'll tell you how I faked a curse at the Renaissance Faire

In West Philadelphia, born and raised

In the basement was where I spent most of my days

Chilling with my friends Max, Donald and Gary

And all playing D&amp;D as my role of a fairy

When two non-player peeps who were engaged and hearty

Said I wasn't invited to the christening party

I took out the player's handbook and simply stared

where it said "Now you must go and curse their son at the Faire."

I whistled for a carriage and when it came by,

The horses' minis were white painted with clamshell dye.

If anything I could say that their coats were rare,

But I thought "Nah forget it, take me to the Faire!"

I pulled up to the park about seven or eight

And I told the King and Queen their son's not doing great.

But he was just fine,

'cause I lied here and there,

So the Prince could stay healthy at the Renaissance Faire.
