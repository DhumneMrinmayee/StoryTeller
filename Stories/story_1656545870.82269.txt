“Another one” you sighed as you look upon another newly burnt corpse of an adventurer that most likely had set his eyes set on you in order to gain fame. 

“Mmpphhh” proudly snorted Ruby, a newly hatched dragon that took you as its parent. 

“….good job” you reluctantly say as you can’t resist his eyes that are looking for praise for bringing you another one of its prey. “Call Mark. Tell him there’s another adventurer. 

Ruby playfully skitters off to get Mark, a necromancer who had just started his path in magic. For some reason, after Ruby was born, a lot of weird fellows had come to swear allegiance to you. You tried to send them away, but they would not listen at all and stayed in front of your farm, begging to let them serve under yourself. In the end, you let them stay because you could’t get them to leave. You decided to have them help you with your farm work because you had nothing better yo do. Mark, in particular, was very helpful because his reanimations made plowing the lands and planting the seeds very helpful. 

You lay back on you chair wondering what you did wrong to end up in this situation. All you ever wanted was to farm the land and live a quiet life. But ever since Ruby was born, your life has become chaotic, with weird people seeking you out and adventurers hoping to kill your to become famous. At first, you tried to built a fence around your farm to protect it, but it didn’t work, then a moat, and then walls, and now your tiny little farm had become a fortress filled with defenses and deterrents, but for some reason, this only attracted more adventures. 

“VILE DEMON LORD” you heard screaming outside, “IF YOU HAVE ANY HONOR YOU’D COME OUT AND” 

“BOOM”

“….”

“Another one” you sighed.
