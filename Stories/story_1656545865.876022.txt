"And, 3, 2, 1-"

KNOCK KNOCK. I got up from my arm chair, and made my way over to the front door. As I opened it, I was greeted by a small girl, no older than nine, wearing a white dress and a silver tiara.

"Trick or treat!"

"Ah, Luna, right on time! Now, I will warn you, I think the Hershey company is skimping out on their chocolate, but  I think Butterfingers are still good."

"Thanks, Mr. Wilkinson!" As I handed her the bar, I got a feeling that panged at my chest.

"Hey, Luna-"

"Yes?"

"Can I talk to you? Just for a moment?"

"Sure. She sat down on my doorsteps and patted the step next to her. "Come on down."

I made my way down, and I sat next to her, though in my old age, it was hard to do without groaning.

"So, what did you want to talk about?"

"Well, it's been over ten years, and I never see you age-"

"Age?"

"Well, ever since I've known you, you're always nine years old."

At that moment, Luna gave a chuckle. "You think I'm nine years old?"

"Well, aren't you?"

"Honestly, Mr. Wilkinson, I thought you would've noticed something about it." Her expression changed. "If you really want to know, it's been more than ten years for me. It's been..." she trailed off as I saw her do the math in her head. "66 years, 7 months, and 22 days."

"So, you're...75?!"

"I should be, but you were close, I'm actually 10." She got up and headed off. "Oh, and thank you for trying, Jimmy; it's been nice to keep up with you."
