Alan Smithee had enjoyed a long career in the movie industry, writing and directing movies over a storied, many year career.  His work filled a special niche, producing the stories that so many wouldn’t ever have their name connected to.  But times were changing, and so much of the new content was being done online, for people to consume not in the darkened room of a theater, but in their own darkened rooms, scrolling thru posts as varied as a cat (wearing clothes that someone thought was humorous), numerous near-identical question and answer discussions about the sexy times posters wanted others to believe they had enjoyed in their early lives, and advice on all numbers of topics by all number of people — some knowledgeable some less so — all dispensed with the certainty that comes from confidence that the responder was 100% correct. Alan was conflicted.  Established in his industry, he could keep doing what he was doing forever.  But the world was changing, and he wanted to play in this new media.  And so was born u/deleted.    The author for when there would be no  author, contributing ideas across the whole specturm of  this new online world of  entertainment.   And Alan Smithee was happy.
