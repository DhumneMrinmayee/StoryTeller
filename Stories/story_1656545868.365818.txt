Day 365 


It has a been a year. Getting good enough at carving things into wood to start a journal. But not sure what to put. 


My name is Lilian Evans and I was sent back in time. I don't where or when I am, history and geography were never (will never) be my strong point, but there are dinosaurs. They don't bother me much now, but the novelty is wearing off. If I ever run into that bloody wizard again I'll wring his bloody neck. My wish for invulnerability and immortality seems to have worked at least, so no doubt our paths will cross again.



Day 45 since I last saw a living dinosaur 


On further reflection I may have killed them all. I remember once someone telling me that if a human went back to dinosaur times their germs would kill them. I'm going to need some time to process this. 



Day 1 of Adam 


I finally met another human. A man. I dont know his name, he's not much of a talker, but I've been calling him Adam. It seems fitting. 


He's a bit on the hairy side, and his postures not great, but he's a red blooded man, and I'm a woman with needs. I don't even want to think how long it has been. 


I showed him all my favourite spots, and how to make fire. He is proving to be a quick learner. 



Day 500 of Adam 


So sick of Adam. All I did was eat an apple, but he's saying it was his apple tree that I picked it from, therefore his apple. But i was the one who showed him the tree in first place. I'm getting so sick of his holier than thou attitude.
