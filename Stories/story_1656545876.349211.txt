&gt;The cold north wind, salted and wet with droplets whipped from the surface of the waves, blows off the water and strikes the hunter’s calves in the narrow line between her cloak and her wraps; she walks hunched and furtive, trying to angle herself so that less of her skin is left bare to the wind. The hunt was good, the water was kind, and now she needs help to carry the seal, covered in her boat to save the carcass from the birds, to the season-home so that the new-dead can be buried with the shells and bones.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;A seal is good. A seal is appropriate. She had known the new-dead in life, and when the body was alive it had been filled with the grace and bounty of a seal, enough for a feast, swift and hard to catch; the hunter, this evening, will strip the flesh from the fins of the seal and the hands of the new-dead, will work by firelight to preserve the tendons so the hands which had been so gifted to the new-dead are articulated even in the grave. Then the hands will go into the earth, pressed together, the mirror of the wild; the bones which are the same underneath the skin, the fin which shows where people came from when they rose out of the waves. Once they were sea-beasts, and then their fins turned to fingers and they learned to work the rocks and ropes. One day the hunter hopes to learn why, and from where such a sea-change came.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;She nearly slips against the moss. Head too full of ideas. She has wandered too far away in dreams today! But the image of the new-dead hovers. She saw it in the water in the corners of her eyes, the body, curled, still. The stiffness of the dead had come before peace—locked up with blood pooling—eyes fixed—but it blinked. Flesh dried and stretched and the lung-foam of the drowned in its mouth, but it blinked.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;No matter. Tonight it will be buried where the shells of the limpets are buried, and in days they will move from this island to the next, where the limpets have returned, and in a year they will come back to this season-home and it will be new in the water re-made, and they will lay down new shells and bones and bodies.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;More carefully, now, she steps carefully against the scree, and the wind picks up her wet hair and throws it against her face like an insult. She uses the end of her spear as a balance. The grey slate shines like still seas in the remnants of the rain. The blood that flooded her spear-point has run down her wrists as proof of kill; it dries to brown now, and flakes when she moves her fingers. Until she has dressed the kill and set it on the fire she will not wash it off with the saltless river water.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Kin on the ridge! The hunter smiles; the net-weaver is facing away from the sea, patting at the hill with his feet to find a safe path down. Maybe drunk or tired, wobbling. The hunter will help him home. “Net-weaver!” she calls. “I will walk with you. Can you help me? I need new ties for my hair, mine have broken.”  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;The net-weaver turns at the sound of her voice, and then flinches suddenly, as though startled or in pain. The flinch unbalances him. He falls below the edge of stone, but though from the sound of impact he must hit the rock hard and badly he makes no call, only a quiet grunt; the hunter darts forward. The net-weaver, nine or ten days ago, had been bitten badly by a badger, far from its home, too close to the broad ice, and the hunter had worried, because better bites can kill a man. But the net-weaver did not sicken and the wound did not fester. After such luck it would be terrible to break bones in a fall and die. Too many buried in too short a time.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;He lies against the moss like fallen sticks, and when the hunter calls to him he only turns his head. His eyes are paler than they were yesterday, and it takes the hunter a moment of confusion to realise that his pupils have shrunk as narrow as needle-holes in cloth. “Net-weaver,” she says. “Can you stand? I see you’re ill. I can carry you home. Here, you may use my spear.”  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;But the net-weaver doesn’t stand. He moves as though he will, but he pushes his foot clumsily, and when his ankle turns sideways against the rock he tries regardless to stand on it, as though there’s no pain. When his balance fails again and his wrenched ankle slips and jars against the stone he blinks up at the sky as though he’s surprised. His skin is too tight against this face, beaded with sweat, but he’s cold and his eyes are too dry. Shineless.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;“Come,” she says, with deathbed quiet, leaning down to lift his shoulders. “Sit up, that’s all. Don’t worry. I have you. I will call for help.”  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Her wet hair falls against his face—she apologises, mechanically, empty, too worried about whether he can be treated, but he doesn’t just flinch. He shudders and flings himself bodily, spasmodically away, rolling against the earth without regard for the little cuts the gravel tears against his arms and chest. He bleeds sluggishly, and gulps, and grunts again, this time louder. Torn out of his chest like the noise an auk makes when she strikes them with the spear-point. Spittle, foamed like the surface of the sea, rises in his mouth, and he trembles. Then he bares his teeth.

Notes:

The hunter and the net-weaver are part of the coastal Mesolithic Scots people. The details about burial of human hands and feet in limpet-middens with seal flippers, finger to finger, are real, as are the details of the hunter's diet and their seasonal migrations between islands, as far as I know. The explanation of the burials, and her thoughts on the origin of human beings, are not. Whether rabies was present at the time is unclear; its origins are very murky, although it definitely originated in Eurasia.
