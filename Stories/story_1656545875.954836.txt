They don't listen. They don't believe. And so I can't let them find me. They would all die. I don't know why they don't stop. Why so many had to waste their lives. 

I just want to live normally. Wake up, go to work, come home, distract myself with some game or other mindless media and go to sleep. My family lived in a different country, a conscious effort by me to stay as far away as I could from them. 

All it took was one unlucky drunk driver. I was walking home back from work with groceries when I head the screech of brakes, before a car slammed into me and fell apart. I was fine of course, but the driver looked as dead as a person could be.

Turns out, this guy was the son of someone important, at least important enough that I was marked a murderer and the police began a hunt for me. What they hoped to gain from this, even I do not know. 

The couple of police officers who came into my house surely thought that they were hunting for a dangerous murderer, or maybe they were trigger happy. However, the instant they saw me, one of them fired, and it was enough. The death of officers was enough for the government to mark me as a villain, a threat to society. 

They sent in the military before I could run away, go into hiding. And that's what caused the horrible event that exposed me to the world, the "Death of a Million". It was a tragic day, with me crying out for them to stop, that they were simply killing themselves. They did not stop, and they did not stop dying. 

And now here I am, in the middle of nowhere hiding away from all of humanity for there is no one who doesn't know my face. They think I am evil, I want to rule the world. But no, I am just a normal man, who wishes to live a normal life. A normal man with an abnormal power "I reflect all damage, while taking none". However,  they don't listen. They don't believe.
