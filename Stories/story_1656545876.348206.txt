"So these people, they're monsters?" My daughter was trying hard process the lesson I was teaching. Seated on our front steps on a beautiful day, only the birds could distract us.

"Something like that, yes. As close to real monsters as can be," I answered. My daughter stared at the ground in thought, eyes darting back and forth as she pieced together new questions.

"And their faces, they dont look like people?" She asked.

"They don't look *right*," I corrected, "they make faces like people, to show emotion. Happy, sad, things like that. But they dont actually feel them, they dont feel anything. They're just faking it."

"How do I know if someone is one of them?" I was proud to hear her taking this seriously.

"Well, it can be tricky. They're very good at earning our trust and being charming so they can prey on us. The best thing you can do is trust your instincts. We evolved to recognize these 'people' for what they are."

"Predators?" She asked, eyes full of innocence.

"Predators," I confirmed.

We took some time to sit in silence together. Her world view had just been challenged in a deep and frightening way. No more was it just a world of friendly or unfriendly people.

"What do they want from us?" She asked.

"Sometimes to hurt us. Sometimes to take things from us. It doesn't really matter. Gazelle dont wonder why the lion is near, they know it'll only bring harm."

She nodded, "And that's why you want me to stay away from Uncle Tony? That's who we're talking about isn't it?"

"Clever girl. Yes it is, but there are others."

"He makes me feel funny. He stands too close to me, his eyes don't look at me normal. He laughs wrong too, like he's just coughing," she fidgeted, like she was ashamed. But I was proud, damn proud of her.

"That's your instincts hon! Listen to those and you'll be ok."

She leaned against me, and I leaned back. The predators of the world would always get their fill, but Id make sure there was easier prey than my girl.
