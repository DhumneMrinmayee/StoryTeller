as my eyes expand in horror as I watch the bag fly down. I quickly reach into my bag for my rope, my eyes search for something I can wrap the rope around. I sigh in relief as I find a branch sticking out the edge. The sound of a thousand quarters streaming downwards flows into my ears as I wrap the rope around the branch. I hesitantly lower my leg and scan for a secure spot to stand on. The jingling is getting louder now. My mind is only stuck on coordinating with my body and safely getting me down without losing my life. I blink heavily to push out the sweat streaming down into my eyes. One step down after another I feel my brain getting dizzy, falling short of oxygen. 
I stop moving and look up onto the blank blue sky, I close my eyes and take a deep breath, more focused on the auditory inputs and the heat of the sun splashing onto the back of my head. 
And suddenly a new sound flows in equal amounts into both of my ears, a high pitched hiss mixed with a grainy rattling. I snap my eyes open and gasp in horror as I see myself situated right in front of a khaki rattle snake camouflaged inside the crack of the layered stone.
death is staring right at me with its pointy eyes I scream and let my feet off the stone as I take a half assed leap of faith, my hands getting sand papered by the rope as gravity pulls me down. I feel sharp pains on my left tricep and back as I spiral down. I need to stop myself from falling down as I donâ€™t know what faith could be waiting for me on the bottom. And I suddenly crash and the sound of metallic rain suddenly quiets down. my jaw opens up in surprise and relief as I find the cotton bag under my ass.
