The woman looks over me and replies "Well... you dont look like one but if you say you are, that's enough for me." She steps aside to show a dead man laying down.  I move the crowd away to get some space before pulling out a book and chalk. I mutter to myself, thinking, as I have been out of practice for some time. The woman paces around the incantation circle and says "Well? Are you almost done?" She asks with an impaitent trill in her voice. I sigh and turn to glace at her "My good woman, this isn't flarking Magecraft and Potions. This is Necromancy. It's like Artificing for Wizards." I reply before snapping back to my work. After I finish, I stand and mutter some words from my book. Glowing green and black swirls of magic surround the dead man and as I finish, he slowly rises and the tendrils of magic flow into his body but then suddenly... the lights flicker then vanish as his body tumbles to the ground. An air of silence is heard before I mutter "Snapes Slithering Snake!" I glance over the runes and things I have placed on the ground before saying "There's that Rune! I always forget it!" I finish adding the rune in a small spot that it barely fit into and the magic continued like nothing happened. 

A few month later... she came back to me "I never got to say, thank you." I don't face her. My cloak is lifted to cover my face and a gruff, deeper voice of my own comes out "it's nothing... you, could, pay me back though..." And I turn and my eyes are glowing with a horrific green and my face is covered with burns. I reach out towards this now terrified woman and then I place my hand on her shoulder "You know... a coffee would be nice right about now, it might help with my sore throat."
