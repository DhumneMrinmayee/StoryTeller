You try to be quiet, but the leaves under your feet betray you, letting out their last breath in a soft crackle. It wasn't much of a noise. But it was enough.

In the distance, appears a glint of yellow, no, two, four... eight. The moon is full, and a cold, short breeze comes and seems to crawl down your spine. 

*Shit, do you see them Narea?* 

Nerea’s nightsight sees even more than the ominous eyes. She can make out the silhouettes of what look like wolves, if only enlarged two or three times. 

*I do, get ready* 

*I will cast a shield around us, it will protect us from any dark energy.*

*Thanks, Eleanor. I’ll get my magic missiles ready. Should I concentrate on one or try to get three separate ones?*

*Focus on one, Claperois. Let’s see how strong these bastards are…* 

*Ha-char, we will stand behind you, get ready to smash*

*…hehehehe*

Eleanor, Narea, Ha-char, and Claperois get ready, and they look toward Gareth, a self-proclaimed wizard who is joining on this quest. They have just met at the local inn, and this is their first engagement together. 

*Are you are ready to proceed?* 

*I guess the wizard doesn’t reveal his secrets...* 

OK, roll for initiative. 5, 2, 13, 19, 2. Who has higher dexterity? Eleanor or Gareth?… OK. 

Ha-char. You’re up.

*OH YES!.. I will charge, and swing with my warhammer! Say hello to THIS, little doggie!*

Your warhammer connects and lifts the Dire Wolf off of its feet and it slides about 10 feet away. 27 damage. But, his friends didn’t like that. The next one goes to bite. 8 damage! 

*Just a flesh wound…*

Claperois you’re up. 

*I focus all three missiles on the one that Ha-char hit* 

You lift up your hands, and three hovering missiles seem to smell blood in the air as they hiss through the night and connect with the Wolf. He clearly had some broken bones from the first hit, and your strikes find this weaker spot and blast him against a tree — he is down, dead. 

*ALL RIGHT!* 

*Nice!*

*Good one, Clap*

*Next* 

Yes, OK… next up is the third Dire Wolf. He dashes toward the group.

*Did he cross me?!*

Yes.

*Attack of opportunity!* 

Roll for attack. 

—sigh— That hits. 

*HA! Smashing pumpkins? More like Smashing Wolves! Nat 20!*

I can’t believe it. How do you want to do this? 

*Smash smash!!!*

Right. The wolf, so focused on his friend being blasted to death, dashes in rage at the source of the missiles, right in the path of our lovely big Dragonborn Fighter. As the wolf is running full speed, you bring up warhammer, and kind of like a mousetrap, you time it perfectly and absolutely crush the skull of the wolf. His body rolls from the initial momentum in some sort of somersault, right to the feet of the rest of the group.

*Amazing! Nice Ha-char!*

*Two down!*

*Let’s go!!!* 

*Proceed* 

OK. Now we have Narea. What are you doing? 

*I swiftly try to sneak up on the third wolf. And swing my half-staff at him…*

*hit him with a stick! hit him with a stick!*

Alright, roll for stealth! … You succeed … Advantage on attack roll … Oh no, that does not hit. 

*… I follow up with bare-handed attack.* 
(A bit of laughter is shared around the table, this seems to happen a lot.)

*Punch him in the face!*

OK. … That hits! Roll for damage … 4 damage. Well, the wolf is more surprised than hurt. He couldn’t take his eyes off of the staff as it was swung, and his head kind of followed it toward the right. Then, you come in closer and give him a good whack right near his temple. Now, it’s Elenaor. 

*I transform into the Dire Wolf. And go to bite this same wolf. Let’s see who has the sharper bite!*

You reach up to the sky, and your eyes turn green, a flash and then you start to transform right before our eyes, into a giant Dire Wolf. Roll for attack. That hits! Roll for damage. Oh! 14 damage! Ouch! … you run up to the wolf. It is both still a bit woozy from the last strike, and a bit confused to see you running at it, so you get right past its defense and leave a nasty gash along the side of the wolf’s neck. He is badly wounded.

It is the turn of the last wolf now. Seeing that his friends have been devastated without much luck, he turns and flees. There is only the one wounded wolf left. Gareth, you are up. 

*Finish*

You want to finish him? Well, you have to attack him first. Do you have a spell ready? Or what do you do? 

*I choose the F: drive* 

The “F Drive”? Sorry I’m not familiar with that one. What is the saving throw? What does it say there on your sheet?

*Not enough space.” 
 
…uh… to write it down? I can look it up then.

*I do not accept the agreement*

OK. What? What do you do then?

*Retry* 

Fine. With the … “F Drive”?

*External Source*

What kind of source? 

“External”

OK… um… whatever source this is… Let’s go with it. Roll for attack. 

*Status 17%*

17? That hits. Roll for damage.

*Please wait*

…

Well? What is the damage? 

*Complete corruption. Fall back to previously installed version.* 

Corruption? It was a dark external source then. OK. You lift your… do you have a wand?

*Keys and a mouse.*

…right. You, take the keys, open some sort of window, a portal of sorts, and you drag the mouse up to it. You squeeze the mouse, and some sort of process begins, as if it were in a black box. Colors and shapes change, and all at once, it is over. The wolf seems to choke from the inside, as if a virus takes hold of his lungs. He struggles, and collapses. You did it. 

*Whoa.. that was weird*

*…Nice job, Gareth..?*

*I like smash better.*

*A dark wizard, eh? It was setup for you!*

… *Complete.*

Well, adventurers. You fended off the pack of Dire Wolves. Good job. Now, you proceed onward along the path, until you see an enormous house, it fills half of the sky. It’s roof, almost in shambles. The garden left unkempt, with wild vines stretching like tendrils toward the gate, which is only patchwork at this point, opened and broken all over. What strikes you most though, are the windows; there are too many to count, and they are all a little different. At the top, however, is a window so large, it takes up almost the entire room of the floor. In the corner, you see a faint blue light. 

Gareth's face lit up ... *Updates are ready*.
