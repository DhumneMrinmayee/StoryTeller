It's  been a month since  it started ,the ' *promise pandemonium'*  . Everyone seems to be affected . Its all chaos ,many have gone crazy , many in comatose  which is concerning as the doctors  too are on their promised holidays . There are no restaurants open , most essential workers have quit and with groceries depleting rather very quickly , my future seems bleak. The world is literally crashing down and yet I am here studying my endless backlog of my course . The moment I get up for more than an hour , my legs and back start hurting , head and eyes ache. Well , it seems this is my limit to continue writing on reddit  because my back has started hurting .I am going back to study my biology , gosh promises can really hurt sometimes.
