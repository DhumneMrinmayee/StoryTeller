"Jesus christ, it's not that deep." The warlock placed his palm on his forehead, as the unchosen warrior continued his questioning mumbles. All the warlock could pick up on was 'what makes us human?'

For a second, the warlock almost gave up being evil due to the sheer boredom that was unfolding in the damp, dark ruins. The warlock had several spells readied, but yet couldn't fire. The Unchosen was in a monologue. The rules of being evil is to never attack while they are speaking. 

"Are any of us human?" The unchosen looked at the warlock, who was glad he could finally answer a question. Only to be disappointed that the question was a stupid one.

"Your team was literally comprised of an elf, a wolf, and an orc... not all of us are human!" The warlock withstrained himself from yelling, having to use a spell to lower his voice in an attempt to get any other villain trapped in the unchosen's horrible scheme of monologues.

"That makes you racist, then." The Unchosen seemed almost done with his monologue. "But yet..." The continuation nearly broke the warlock.

"I AM EVIL! KILL ME!" The warlock shouted, frustrated and broken. In that moment, even the warlock thought death was a better alternative then this monologue, which has nearly reached the fourth hour. 

The unchosen obliged, finally slicing at the chest of the warlock.

"However, changing makes us human." The monologue continued, trapping the warlock between life and death as he is forced to listen to the monologue yet still. It felt like days before he realized something was up. The Unchosen hadn't moved from his spot. Within seconds, the warlock remembered an illusion spell he placed to confuse the party. The spell was supposed to continue speaking as one of the party members, until the party left the cave.
