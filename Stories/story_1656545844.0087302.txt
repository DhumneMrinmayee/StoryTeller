It wasn’t long before I realized life as a human, was better than life as a dusty chest in a dungeon. 

It also wasn’t long that I became able to support myself, becoming a ‘waitress’ at a gathering spot for the same beings who would seek to kill me were my form to be revealed. 

There have been a couple close calls, learning the intricacies of human behavior and how to smile were my biggest obstacles. 

 I  suppose learning how to be a waitress and a housekeeper was mildly difficult as well, humans make the rooms so messy sometimes and their table manners are… uncouth to say the least. But what would a monster know. 

Oh, and the magic ones. They can see me sometimes, but I slip to the back of the tavern before they can establish my true identity. 

Being new in town, I was becoming suspected of missing adventurers that frequented our bar. I was able to create an alibi and convince them I had no part in the disappearances, simply by letting them observe my movements. I never left the tavern for an entire two weeks, but still, adventurers went missing. 

Life has been very good, I enjoy the human meals and sleep in a soft bed. I’ve made “friends” and I can buy whatever I want with my wages. 

I thought being a human was the most satisfying mimicry I’d achieved yet. I didn’t want to shift back into inanimate objects. 

But as I wipe the blood from my mouth and my lower half turns from a bed and back into human legs, I realize some things never change, even for a mimic.
