AITA for wanting my daughters kidnapper punished?

I (45m king) and my wife (35f queen) have a nice life together with a lovely daughter(16f princess), a few days ago my daughter had some weird dream about riding on the back of a dog and kissing a soldier, probably nothing, but decide to get one of my daughter's lady-in-waiting to keep an eye on her through the night, what's the worst that could happen?

Apparently some dog kidnapped my daughter again! but the lady-in-waiting chassed after her made a big chalk x on the door of her kidnapper so we could arrest the fucker, but come morning every door in the damme city had a chalk x on it! so my wife in all her brilliance decides to make a large silk bag for our daughter and fills it wheat grains, but the is, it had small hole, allowing us to find the bastard(26m ) and look him up.

now moments before the bastard get's hanged he makes a request, to get to smoke a last pipe of tobacco, i allow it, what could go wrong it's just a bit smoke after all. he strikkes his tinderbox once, twice and thrice and three great dogs stand before him. one with eyes the size of tee cups, one with eyes the size of watermills, and the final one with eyes of a great tower, he commands the beasts to throw the judge and jury dozens of yards in the air demands to be let go in spite of his crimes! when I refuse the beasts attack me and my wife only stopping when the peasants declare him king in fear! and he was to have my daughter as his wife!

sorry for bad grammar, english is a second language.
