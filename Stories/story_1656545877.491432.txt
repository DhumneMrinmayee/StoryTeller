"Agent 36, rouge dragon in your sector. Repeat. Agent 36..."

I sighed and went out of my small room in a mall. Dragons. I hate them. Big lisard-like sentients and their robots, both wielding powerful magic and having anger issues.

On my watch I saw a probable location. The fountain. It could mean a water bender. I got to it in little to no time and began my magic.

I have always been a strange kid, the "quiet in a corner with a book" type. After the first contact humans began sprouting magic powers all over the globe and I was no exception. But, just like everything else about me, it was also weird. I could tell stories. That's it. When others got something like fire manipulation, or waterwalking, or even an ability to talk with computers, I had telling stories.

But on the second day I noticed something interesting. Earth was devoid of magic for millions of years. No earthen creature is used to it, and magic is really costly. Dragons could eat their weight in meat in a day, despite being roughly human-sized. Salurians, ancient mechanical butterflies, charge all day from each and every source they find. Plutarians developed extremely efficient spells and still rarely use them more than fifty times a day. Humans... Let's just say we can cast only a tiny bit. But my power? It had little to no cost at all. I could talk down anyone, and even if it took me all day I won't be tired.

It took me quite some time to figure out how to use it, and I don't really know all my possibilities. Still, I reckon I can be more powerful than anyone else.

Instantly I whispered some syllables for a plutarian spell of demonstration, and the dragon stared at me.

 - Hey? Hello?

I summoned a salurian shield before ice shrapnel got me. 

 - One upon a time there lived a beautiful lisard...

I got its attention. On average they need a minute or two between attacks.

 - That was kind and polite, and loved water - just like you.

The dragon was female. That was a good sign... Only if nothing touched her eggs. The hologram behind me began swirling blue and purple.

 - And she didn't wrecked all windows. No. She stepped down from the fountain...

Mistakes were made. The dragon jumped down from the tallest point of the fountain, carrying a large mass of water with it, and of course it splashed everywhere else, when it released the mass.

When I finished telling the story of a beautiful dragon, the real one stood for a couple of seconds before me, before shaking off the simple hypnosis, and thanking me laconically.

No one can resist listening to a good story. Even the reality itself. The shop where the rampage began dried out, as there had never been a violent dragon. Some damage still remained, but it was fixable. All well, that ends well, right?
