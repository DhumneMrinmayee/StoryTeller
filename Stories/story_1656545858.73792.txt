"The perfect shot", said Senator Dalton to no one in particular, as he carefully set his empty glass on the counter in a darkened bar. Loved and loathed in equal measure, Dalton was sometimes called the 'Uncrowned King of America' for the power he wielded in D.C., chairing powerful committees and killing or passing legislation as he saw fit.

There was a bright flash, and a young man wearing a press tag and carrying a very expensive looking camera stepped up to Dalton's side. "Well, well, well. If it isn't 'I never touch a drop' Dalton, King of the Hypocrites, in the perfect shot." He turned the camera so Dalton could see the photo just taken. Clear as day, it showed Dalton placing his shot glass on the bar, a smile on his lips. To their surprise, it also showed the face of a third man in the shadows behind Dalton, a gun with a long silencer in his hand. 

A shot rang out, and Dalton's neck exploded in blood, and the photographer fell to the floor, a bullet hole in his temple. 

"The perfect shot indeed," muttered the third man as he took the photographer's camera and hung it around his neck as he walked to the exit.
