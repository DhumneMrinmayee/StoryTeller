At first, many sought out the well of immortality. You call it the fountain of youth, it is no different, we have heard it called many different things over the eons of our lives. Only the strongest could hold their own against others who would seek to steal the fountain from us. We devoted ourselves to defeating any challenger. Though we could not venture far from the fountain for resources, so we became hunters, and the fountain-seekers our prey.  
  
Centuries of life changed us. We were peaceful once, now we only think of the hunt. Our noses perfected to trail the scent of blood for miles, our teeth sharp and weaponized, our hands now claws, made perfect for sinking deep into our victim’s flesh. Our eyes have adapted to see the night with perfect clarity, our movements as silent as a cat, using all four of our limbs for quicker movement. Our arms grotesquely extended to stretch farther, catching our victims before they leave our reach. I never claimed to be proud of what I am, this is simply what we have become to survive.  
  
The way we thought changed too. Our minds scheming, always scanning for prey or predator. We view any we encounter as threats, prey. Trained for deception, to trace fear and strike when we notice it. I once valued my mind, hopeful that an eternity would mean more chances to learn and expand our thoughts, but alas, we are more base than we were before. Our existence has been simplified, some say perfect, though I say cursed.  
  
Thank you, for being stronger. If you had given me the chance to kill you, I would have. Now that I have been trapped, I have the chance to push against my base instincts and speak my true, deep thoughts. They are the only ones I have left.  
  
I warn you, seeker of the fountain, the waters will consume you, as they did me and my people. But I am different, you say. I am a monster, you think. As I said, we weren’t always this way. We were once humans, just like you.
