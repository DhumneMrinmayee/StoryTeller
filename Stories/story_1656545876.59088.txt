**Report CXLIII**

**Type**: Satyr

**Status:** Destroyed

CXLIII was a library located in Alexandria containing an exceedingly large amount of scripts, scrolls and tablets from all known lands, going as far as Britannia with several scripts being of Pict origin. While most of the scripts were perfectly mundane and ordinary, if valuable, it has been discovered that a substantial amount of them contained information not of this Earth.

The situation has been uncovered by Agent Leviticus of the Athena section while she was searching for information on CCXXVI and ways to hunt it. Though Leviticus searched for lore not otherwise secret, she discovered a manuscript that detailed events of the next 4 years. Recognizing it to not be the work of a Sect-approved divinator, she concluded, over the course of the next 3 months, that the predictions were accurate. CXLIII was immediately supplied with \[EXCISED\] more spies of the Diana section for additional information gathering. Over the next year, at least \[EXCISED\] individuals have been apprehended carrying scrolls of similarly impossible knowledge. 

As all information in scrolls in CXLIII is of the future, The Sect's leading concept is it to be the work of either skilled divinators or those capable of harnessing Chronos' power and traversing time itself. Such individuals are currently being looked for by both Sect agents as well as non-Sect Roman legions near Alexandria.

The Five Heads of the Sect have deemed it impossible to know for certain how many scripts in CXLIII contain tainted information, perhaps by a currently unknown cypher. As per their command, CXLIII was destroyed by fire on \[EXCISED\] to prevent tarnishing the Veil.
