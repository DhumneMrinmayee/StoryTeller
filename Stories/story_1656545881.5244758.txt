"OK. Okay. Oh kay... but I mean come-on Jericho, I got a great spot for a good price!" He scrunched his face as he glanced sideways ruminating on his decisions.


"And you wonder why we get nuked?" Jericho Hissed in response. 

"I mean isn't that basically what we planned before we got this place Martin?"

"Uh... yeah. You do have a point there. Guess I shoulda saw that coming."

His questions made his frustrations ricochet like bullet in his skull. Martin may have known it would be trouble, but his stubborn pride made him hunker down jeering back:

"So what aren't you..."

"MARTY!!!"

His mother's call cut in, signaling what he had been anticipating nervously while enjoying the fun; causing him to swear under his breath. 

"Didn't I tell you to get to bed at 8:30?" Her voice was approaching the stairway. 

"It's 1 o'clock in the morning right now. If I catch you on that game and you end up late for school today! Lord so help me I may need a miracle to remove my foot from your behind!!!"

As Martin heard Jericho over the headset snickering at this, his blood surged in his chest leaving him in a flustered mind state. 

"Damn it! Uh, hey Jay I gotta go or else I might end up missing." Clammering around and clearing up his desk his friend couldn't help but reply:

"Don't worry, if anything I will know just where to find you in the grocery store right next to the swine. Or do you think I should collect your hide from the belt section at Walmart first?"

It was not his time to go back and forth seeing as his leathery tan skin was at stake. So instead he opted for a prompt and succinct "go to hell".

Logging off, he hurriedly jumps in bed and finally feeling the 8 hour marathon worth of mmo rpg's fatigue hitting him; his last thought of which was of how he can weasel his way out of what may certainly be the price for his participation in that coveted VR WoW campaign.
