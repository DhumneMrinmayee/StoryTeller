"now look honey, I swear to you, I haven't done anything of the sort. Why would you even think such a thing?" Albert asked. "You know damn well I'm the only vulcano wizard around". Albert was confused "And?". "Well the humans have pedicured Yellowstone is about to erupt, they're evacuating as we speak" she replied with a slight shift in tone. "I know I have a temper, but Yellowstone?! It's has to be terrible so just admit it. You slept with your assistant yesterday didn't you?" Those darn humans and their TeChNoLoGy. "They must have made a mistake, honey, I didn't do anything wrong. I promise ..." He was interrupted by the phone. Sally, already irritated, stomped her way over to the phone. "This better be important!". "It is ma'am" the voice said in a very calming way. Sally could feel herself cooling down a bit. " You see, we've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty and I ----- beeeeeeeeeeeep"

"Sales people, the end of humanity, ... who would've thought." Albert said as he tried sweeping the ash off of his glasses.
