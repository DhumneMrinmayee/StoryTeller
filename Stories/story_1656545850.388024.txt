Sometimes our DM would just get so invested into things. After finishing "collage" or whatever that was, we set out on a quest to find happiness and to live the best normal lives we could. I set sights for my character to become the best tax accountant that ever was on the planet. 

It was a lofty ambition sure, but I had to keep things exciting. Our first quest was to fix the broken down economy. And lemme tell you, it required a lot of flipped burgers and filling paperwork for us to even know the source of the problem. Turns out it was some lame conspiracy where the "government" or whatever was helping fun all these "mega-corporations" or whatever and all the money was going to the rich people. We all thought that was lame though, cause it was just too similar to what was going on in the human monarchy system here, like why make something normal and treat it like it's evil right?

It took awhile but the dm gave us a much more exciting adventure of imperfect economies, poor focus groups, and a divided nation with different focuses that just couldn't compromise. It sounded like the dm kept the message the same, but we were happier with the complexity. 

Jerry said he wanted his character to run for President and we are all setting up his campaign right now. Little does the country or dm know we plan on doing a hostile takeover and changing the legislature to full on Communism so we can eat the rich!

Wait we can't literally eat them?
