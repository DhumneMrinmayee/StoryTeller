A Nighttime Chat

**I know I come with some challenges but I really thought we had a connection.**

*We did.  I just worry we come from two different worlds. That we are too different.*

**So we will have to fight a little for our future.  That's nothing I can't handle. You are worth fighting for.**

*Shouldn't it be easier?  Relationships shouldn't have to be a struggle from the start.*

**Put any two people in a room and my work begins.  That's been the same from the dawn of time.  But with you, after our last date, all I wanted to do was plant you flowers and watch a sunrise.  It was a nice change.**

*I felt the same way.  My friends did not.  Each of those couples broke up mere hours later.*

**They were already doomed. You can't deny that. I mean, who orders a side salad and then just expects her date to let her eat all the fries off his plate?**

*It's really true.  She always does that.*

**Please say you will see me again. I think you are someone special, someone worth the struggle.  I see us building something worthy of protection together.**

*I do too.*

**Where can I meet you?  Mini golf?  Movies? Hot Dog vendor on 16th street?**

*The Botanical Gardens.  I like what you said about flowers.  Let's see what grows.*

**I'll be there.**  **Good night.**

*Night.*
