I would like to you all see this. This brave woman that was your champion, see what you have done to her. I am not the villain, that is what I have been trying to warn you all. She got crushed by your own system by being a mother, a worker, a woman and a “super-hero”. She battle for the Status-quo and what did it bring to her? Depression, loneliness, despair and now she is abandoned. Am I the real villain here? Really? Did she got paid when I tried to destroy the banking system? No. Did she got a relief from her nanny when I kidnapped all those billionaires in a Saturday evening? No. You are the real villian. I just would like to say that I support you, Arachnea, and I wish you the best recover and my lair is open whenever you need someone to talk to.
