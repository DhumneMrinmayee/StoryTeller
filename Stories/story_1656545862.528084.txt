Again with the shouting eldritch signs. Of course I am depressed unhappy and anxious. I’m a broker. Emissary between humans, demons, eldritch abominations and whatever else comes out of those portals that just randomly opened a few years ago.

The money’s great, but the eldritch creatures are starting to become a problem. Take a depressed human or despondent demon, twist their biology a little, and soon you have another object made of flesh.  I was recently recruited by a high ranking demon to investigate, and I know I’ve got the stomach for this. Even the ground here is an eldritch creature.

But I will not break. I’m one of the best brokers because I have the will to endure this. Being the child of human and demon helps, but it only goes so far. Conviction makes the difference, and no matter what, I will never be one of them. The memory of my sister is proof enough of that.

Somewhere in the eldritch sector. That’s all I know. If she was turned, I can only hope she remembers me. And if she doesn’t, I will still bring her captors to justice. I owe her that much. That’s why I became a broker in the first place. I will find her.
