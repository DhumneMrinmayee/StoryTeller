Government: "No."

Not-Hero-Guy: "Then why did you put a price on my head?"

Government: "Because you are a threat."

Not-Hero-Guy: "BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?!"

Government: "So? We don't give a fu***k, we will kill you for disturbing the peace."

Not-Hero-Guy: "Says the one who ignored the people you're supposed to be protecting... wait a minute."

Government: "Now hold on-"

Not-Hero-Guy: "YOU LAZY FU***KS! YOU JUST WANTED ME TO DO YOUR FU***KING JOB FOR YOU! YOU ABSOLUTE A***SHOLES! THAT'S IT! I'M BECOME A VILLAIN! HAVE FUN DEALING WITH THAT YOU MOTHER FU***KERS!"
