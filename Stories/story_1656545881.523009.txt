“Home is where the heart is after all,” I said.

“That doesn’t change the fact that you’ve died in this house 349 times so far,” said Jim.

This wasn’t the first time a time traveler had come to me to try and get me out of my time loop. At first, I had created a loop field around my living space so that I could relive the same day over and over again. Each time I would do something different, usually leading to my brutal death, but after about death 100 I got used to it. 

“Truth be told, I just don’t want to go back to reality again. I like the predictability here. I can take notes and observe things because each day happens the same and I can experiment safely and go back to normal,” I said.

Jim sighed and looked at me.

“You’ve been crushed by your refrigerator, stung to death by wasps, and have been set on fire and you still prefer this to reality? How can you be afraid of the outside when all this has happened to you?” asked Jim.

“But the outside is scary,” I said.

“Well as a time traveler, I can’t force you to take any actions. I can only try and guide you in the right path. Seeing as how you don’t want to touch any grass, I’ll be returning every day until you do.”

“Ok that’s fine. I don’t care, I'm going to have my morning coffee,” I said.

I walked over to my coffee maker and grabbed the mug. The unexpected heat from the handle caused me to spill it on a wire and electrocute myself yet again. Jim sighed and shook his head as I got ready to enter the next loop.

“If this is what you really want then go for it,” said Jim. “But just remember, the longer you’re here, the tougher it’ll be to escape your ‘comfortable’ loop.”

I knew Jim was right deep down, but at this point the house was a part of me. If I was going to escape, I’d have to change everything I knew. My comfort zone would be broken, but sometimes that’s what needs to happen for change.
