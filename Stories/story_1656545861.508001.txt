I heard my Elvis disc playing as I woke up from a very, very horrible nap. My old man’s recliner was stiff, and was basically ruined. But, why was I awake?

I got out of the silly chair and stretched before tripping over a bunch of containers of alcohol. I looked at almost all the empty bottles of expensive brands and cheap beers. 

My surprised expression made my dog come up to me and lick my face. She ran to the open window next to my unlocked door. I followed her and to my surprise,

The sun was still out. Bright and uncomfortable to stare at. The streets were filled with confused people. Some were dressed incredibly stylish, and others were not dressed at all. I couldn’t blame them. It was supposed to be our last day. The world was doomed. The shops were looted. The roads were torched. There wasn’t supposed to be anything left… but we were all still here. The meteor was meant to hit earth directly after midnight, but we were all standing confused, wondering why we weren’t dead.

My adrenaline wore off. I was now leaning on my door. The amount of alcohol I consumed last night was unbearable. Since it was meant to be my last night, I decided to try alcohol illegally for the first time. The laws didn’t apply to us anymore. We had a whole week to do whatever the hell we wanted. In my 18 years, I’ve never felt so sick to my disgusted stomach. 

My phone began to ring from the coffee table. Since everyone knew the world was still intact, it was probably my boss. In no way was I going to go to work in my condition. I did want to answer the phone though.

I basically Army crawled over to where my phone was. As I read the contact, i noticed it was my friend Clyde. He worked at NASA. He was one of the many workers who warned us about our last week left on earth.

I answered angrily. “You guys lied.” I yelled. 

Clyde gave an awkward laugh. “We may have miscalculated…”
