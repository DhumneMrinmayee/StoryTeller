The Genie looked at the Paladin, his eyes cold. "I'm going to grant your wish, but only on the condition that you agree to do something for me in return."  
  
  
  
The Paladin stared back at the Genie, his eyes unflinching. "I wish that you are now and forevermore a virtuous and philanthropic being who will willingly use their powers to benefit all that is good."  
  
  
  
The Genie's eyes widened in surprise, and then he began to laugh. "That's what I wanted to hear! Now let me see if I can do this." He closed his eyes and concentrated, muttering to himself in an ancient tongue that sounded vaguely familiar.  
  
  
  
After a moment, the Genie's eyes shot open and he took a deep breath. "Okay, I think I've got it. Now, what was your wish?"  
  
  
  
The Paladin smiled, a genuine smile that reached his eyes. "I wish that you are now and forevermore a virtuous and philanthropic being who will willingly use their powers to benefit all that is good."  
  
  
  
A look of confusion washed over the Genie's face. "What? That's not what you just said."  
  
  
  
The Paladin shrugged. "I guess I just wish that over and over again."  
  
  
  
The Genie's shoulders slumped, as if heavy with years of disappointment. "That's it? That's your wish?"  
  
  
  
The Paladin nodded.  
  
  
  
The Genie sighed. "Well, okay. I guess that's better than nothing." He cleared his throat and spoke in a booming voice. "I wish that you are now and forevermore a virtuous and philanthropic being who will willingly use their powers to benefit all that is good."  
  
  
  
He snapped his fingers, and suddenly, the room was filled with blinding light. Both the Paladin and the Genie shielded their eyes as the light grew in intensity, until everything around them was a brilliant white. When it finally subsided,  
  
  
  
The Paladin found himself in a completely different place. The room he had been in before had disappeared, replaced by a beautiful garden. Sunlight streamed down from a clear blue sky, and a gentle breeze brushed through the trees and flowers, filling the air with the scent of jasmine and roses.  
  
  
  
A crystalline fountain stood in the center of the garden, and the water flowed smoothly over the sides, forming a gentle waterfall. The Paladin walked over to the fountain and stared down at the water. It was so clear that he could see the bottom, and he could see that the fountain was full of fish.  
  
  
  
He smiled and reached down to touch the water. It was cool and refreshing, and he could feel the power of the magic flowing through it. He closed his eyes and let the magic wash over him, and he felt a sense of peace and calm settle over him.  
  
  
  
When he opened his eyes again, he saw that the Genie was standing next  
  
  
  
The Paladin felt a sense of wonder and awe as he looked at the garden. It was so beautiful and peaceful, and he could feel the magic flowing through it. He had never seen anything like it before, and he knew that he would never forget this place.  
  
  
  
The Genie smiled at him and said, "This is the Garden of Eden. It is a place of peace and magic, and it is a place where you can find answers to your questions."  
  
  
  
The Paladin nodded and said, "Thank you. I have never seen anything like this before. It is so beautiful."  
  
  
  
The Genie smiled and said, "Yes, it is. I created it especially for you, because I know that you are a man of virtue and courage. I believe that you have the potential to do great things, and I hope that you will use your powers to help others."  
  
  
  
The Paladin nodded and said, "I will. I promise."
