**"Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116,"** wrote the monkey.

"You called?" spoke the abomination of flesh from behind me.

"It was a *joke*," I groused, throwing my hands in the air. "One. Stupid. *Joke.*"

The quivering entity reached out with one spindly arm and gave me a tentative pat on the shoulder. I slapped its hand that barely remembered how to be made of flesh off my shoulder. Albin didn't bother me anymore; I'd seen far worse than them in the past few weeks. Besides, Albin was nice enough. Kept the house in order, occasionally broke the fabric of space, and gave me privacy when I needed it.

It said something that an entity from beyond the rifts was the best roommate I'd ever had.

"Fhqwhgadshgnsdhjsdbkhsdabkfabkveybvf," the next paper read.

"That can't possibly have any meaning," Albin observed.

"Yeah, I think it's been too long," I agreed. I ran a hand through my hair. After the preliminary results from Albin came in, the Academy had actually gotten me a grant and a deadline to show results by, and I wasn't going to turn my nose up at an opportunity to get some cash. So even if this whole damn experiment had started out as a joke, I was going to do it right. "Want to do another exposure?"

"Rift's ready," Albin said. "You've got the mortal?"

"His name's Jim," I decided on the spot, "and he's going to come back just fine from today's exposure. Just like all the other times."

I picked up the docile monkey with one arm—the Academy's trainers really were miracle workers—and walked downstairs, to the rift in spacetime that sat in my rental house's basement. It took a while, since the hallway kept folding in on itself and I nearly fell down an infinitely recursive hole, but that kind of thing was par for the course when a hole in reality was lying around.

"No entities on the other side of the rift," Albin decided, poking their sensory-blob through the wound in the world. "We're good to go."

"Good luck, Jim," I said, patting the monkey on the back. I tied a rope to his waist and picked him up.

Then I tossed him out of reality.

I'd gone on the other side of the rift myself, as a curiosity—as rifts went, this one was fairly safe to go through if you had a guide who knew what they were doing, and my teacher had apparently spent quite a bit of time there herself. The strange thoughtspace that powered spatial magic was a drifting whirlwind of spatial eddies and distant memories, sluicing through the void like half-remembered dreams. Usually, those eldritch secrets were nothing more than random noise, only remembered in subconscious bursts or with extreme luck.

But if you had enough subconsciousnesses to expose to the rifts, and enough time, maybe you could extract something of use.

I reeled the monkey back in; Jim seemed no worse for the wear after his time on the other side of the rifts. He joined the other trained monkeys in the basement, and I walked past the noise of stolen memories being printed by the yard.

I reached Jim's station and stopped, reading out the newest haul from his latest exposure.

"dQw4w9WgXcQ," the monkey wrote.

I sighed. "More meaningless garbage," I said.

"Well," Albin hazarded, "we *are* grabbing completely random memories from thoughtspace. Maybe it means something to someone else."

"Maybe," I muttered, rubbing my eyes. "I'm going to sleep. Wake me up if the monkeys start telling us about... I dunno, buried treasure or something."

I slogged upstairs, realized I was walking up the infinite staircase again, and backtracked until I returned to normal physical space. My room had somehow shown up behind me—stupid spatial rift—and I slumped inside and fell asleep.

Damn monkeys. Sure was a shame that none of that gibberish had any meaning.
