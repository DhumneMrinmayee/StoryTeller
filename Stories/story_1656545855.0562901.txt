Ashley looked up. "How did this happen?" She asked, pointing to the sleeping boy. 

Mira shrugged. "How the hell should I know?" She asked, scratching hers ear. "We should see what will happen."

Ashley shook hers head. "It could be- gross." She looked at the red head. "You know, you look pretty today."

The pale girl smirked. "As always. But now we have him there... Let's do some experiments." She laughed and looked at hers friend. "C'mon Pup, let's have some fun..."

Ashley smiled softly before lifting the boy up and putting his head underwater.
