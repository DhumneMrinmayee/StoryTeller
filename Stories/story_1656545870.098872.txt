Joe rogan smashed his glistening kettlebell like skull into Commander KIllmurder's 3000 series ballistic combat helm and growled like a ape about to go nuts "pull the mission. NOW" Killmurder gave an audible scoff and spat his gum out into his own visor. "Pah, I don't listen to scum like you, you're here because the brass, you're just a liability, and the mission goes on" Joe looked him straight in the eye, the gum on Killmurder's visor hid the smirk forming on the right side of his mouth. "Alright men, " Killmurder started "let's roll out, Bloodgore, Lieutenant Organsmash, watch flank, General Visceral, you take Bonesplosion and Honeypuff to alpha point, I want eyes on all decision points, as soon as you see a bitch you shoot on sight is that clear. Call em if you see em. GO! " The squad took off, Rogan shook his head and started pumping his arms and legs in perfect rhythm with his soldiers. "I got a bad feeling about this..." He said under his breath. "SILENCE IN THE COMS SOLDEIER" Killmurder barked. "s-sorry" Joe responded. Out of nowhere, commander killmurder opened his 763-69-00 assault tactical social vest and revealed a pulse grenade. "Alright squad, im going to kill us all now, brass's orders." Joe rogan let out a ape like scream and bounded for him like a gorilla on planet of the ape (2011 one)." Killmurder watched him and pulled the grenade string. The whole team was blown sky high and tooken out immediately.
