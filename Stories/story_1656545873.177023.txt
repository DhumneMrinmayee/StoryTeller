'Gin &amp; tonic?' I ask, polishing the glasses for umpteenth time. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















'Something harder, pal. Much harder.' A raspy voice answers. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















'Something harder coming right up.' I say, as I prepare a concoction. Mrs Harper had given me a little something that helps tongues loosen up faster. Time to use that. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















Five drinks later, I ask, 'Dames, huh?'
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















'Bi... bi... big tom... ' my mark whispers more words &amp; keeps talking. Five drinks &amp; already out for the count? Big Tommy's palookas have softened over the years, it seems. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















Then, I digest the situation. Tony Mallard's wife had asked me to tail him. The usual stepping husband stuff. Seems like Tony here knew Thomas 'Big Tommy' Mancini a bit too well. Mob &amp; me. What a combination. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















I wonder if Mrs Mallard knew that her husband was in cahoots with the mob. It changes the situation. Tony droned on, 'Big Tommy wants the dame dead. He's running scared.'
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















My name is Harry Sloane, and I am a PI. After hanging my shingle, I found out the hard way that a bartender earns lot more than a PI. Also, he is a treasure trove of information. The bartender, not the PI. Plus, I don't have to prise out information the hard way, when I am sidelining as a bartender. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















'Big Tommy? He is more likely to die of a heart attack than a dame.' That's me. 𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘧𝘺 𝘉𝘪𝘨 𝘛𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘺? 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘢 𝘥𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵? Tony looks at me. He suddenly decides that he has said too much. Even sloshed, he tries to vamoose. I hold him by his collar. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















So much for not using the hard way. He tries to land two blows on me. They are not effective, but they put the distance between us. He somehow makes it to the exit. So do I. We both spot his Mercedes. We have the same thought: run! 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















To this day, Tony insists that it was the only wise decision we geniuses made. It is true. No sooner do we reach the Mercedes, than the bar explodes. We are far enough to not to be made into fried chicken, yet close enough to feel the heat. Tony gains his voice first. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;



















'Wh... Who are you?! What's happenin'?' Guess he is stone cold sober now. 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




















'Sorry about that, pal.' I too gain my voice. 'Looks like.... looks like the cook left a burner on.'
