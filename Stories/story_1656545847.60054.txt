You'd think being a vampire is oh so cool and all. I thought it'd be too but all this means is that I can't get a day-job and, on top of all, I can only eat blood. Blood. You know how hard it is to get the thing? There're no apps that bring you some for you to eat, there's no easy way to get it either! Sure you can go and drink some random dude and risk some STD, but even if you're lucky enough at your 3rd time people are gonna notice and then you're on a time limit 'til a cop or a vampire hunter finds you and kill you.

So what about power? Money? Well, it's the same as some dude except I don't need to plan around lifting a couch when I do spring cleaning. Rent has gone up like crazy, I can tell you that and even tho I would love to eat the heart of Angel, my roommate I'd rather keep paying rent with him. Really, not even werewolves are doing better. Sure, they can eat any raw animal but unless they have the kicks off living in the jungle then getting food is as hard for them as any human being.

Tomorrow I have another interview and so help me Satan if this dude pays less than 10 an hour I am drinking him dry right on the spot and fuck the consequences.

Yours, truly
