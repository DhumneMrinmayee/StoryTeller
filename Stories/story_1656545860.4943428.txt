Jesus Christ! Are you the one getting my dog drunk...again?!       
        
The genie silently appraised me for a moment and said "you don't look particularly sober to me".     
       
"I'm not; but, is that the point?".    
      
"I dunno" he replied, " what is the point?".      
       
"Well, I mean, he's my dog!".      
        
"Yes....and....?".      
         
"No.... you're right. He's got every right to get drunk as I do."

.....

"Even though he lives a dream life", I added on eventually.
      
"Really? A dream life?  This magnificent creature can only take a shit when you allow him to! Think about that for a moment.".      
       
And I did. I did think about it.      
        
"That actually sucks".      
      
"You think?" Said the genie, sort of Staring in disbelief.      
      
"Ok" I said, trying to start over. "I feel like we've got off to a bad start. Can we reset?".     
      
"Sure, why not? You're probably the 1000th drunk dog owner I've surprised.      
      
"Wait, hold on. WTF. This is a regular thing for you?"
