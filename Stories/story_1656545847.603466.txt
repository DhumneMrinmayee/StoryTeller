Aside from this, she was the perfect roommate. She kept the kitchen neat, never touched my food, and pretty much kept to herself. After years of slobby roommates or those who can’t pay their rent on time, I can’t be bothered to search for another. I definitely cannot afford rent by myself either, so I’ve got to learn to look past this. I think we’ve both come to this conclusion independently since we found out a few days ago. I was out on my nightly hunt in an area known to be infested and I came upon her feeding on a man. She looked at me, and I looked at her, then I turned around and walked away from the scene. This is the first time I’ve walked away from a vampire, and I know it’s compromising my morals but she is just too good of a roommate, my selfish reasons are enough for now.
