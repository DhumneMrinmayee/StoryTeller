"Let's have a two-person orgy" i had suggested "cook all the food we have left, spend our last night indulging and fucking like rabbits".

Don't misunderstand me i'm glad to be alive.

But i'm tied to the bed with my fiance sleeping off his hangover, and i need to pee.

Well i suppose it could be worse, the last few functional news channels reported entire cities going to hell to riots, whereas our sleepy neighbourhood came together and sort of numbly agreed to spend our last week in peace, we helped set up cellars for those willing to try and dig in, made half assed promises to attend some barbeques this comming summer, and even halfheartedly agreed with little Timmy when he said the meteor might miss us, smart little guy. 

Anyway, i'm just going to wet the bed now, sue me.
