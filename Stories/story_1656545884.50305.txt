I walked backwards flipping through the spectrums on my visor after I heard the translation.  Then I saw it, a cloud of particulates emerged from the meteorite, the rest of the team, they couldn't see it.  It formed into tendrils in the air and started entering my teammates through the nostrils, eyes, ears and mouths. Whatever it was it went through their protective gear like it wasn't even there. It happened so fast. I was nearly running backwards at this point when I saw a tendril start to head towards me.  I turned around and ran, God help me I ran as fast as I could to the van, my teammates called after me "Hey, where ya goin'?  They were oblivious.  I sped away.  

I managed to keep ahead of the cloud as I called back to base, I had them check my visor recording.  They were able to detect the cloud on a satellite feed, it was spreading in every direction.
