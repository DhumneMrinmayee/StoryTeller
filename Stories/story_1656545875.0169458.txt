I stared at the reeking bag, wondering if it was a hallucination. Were they this vivid? And could you SMELL a hallucination?  I was the only one in the waiting room of the dentist's office, when the secretary entered the room.

"Um, excuse me ma'am - did you.... did you bring that in here??" she asked, clapping her hands over her nose and mouth.

"No! No I didn't...I have no idea how..."

"Well it wasn't here 5 minutes ago. I'm not sure if this is some kind of prank, but you need to leave and take your... belongings... with you." The secretary ran into the back, trying not to gag.

I didn't even bother arguing. She was right - one minute there was a clean waiting room, the next minute there was a bag of literal bull shit. So, okay, I guess that means I'm not hallucinating. But still, who sent that message and was I really, suddenly, omnipotent?? Only one way to find out the latter.

Walking out of the building (sans bag of crap - guess I'll be switching dentists), I noticed a hot dog vendor on the corner and made my way over. "One hot dog with mustard please," I asked.

The vendor threw it together. "Three bucks", he said in a gritty voice.

I hesitated, nervous. "Three bucks, lady," he grumbled.

"You will accept whatever i give you as payment," I said, and pulled a tampon out of my purse. He took it, stuffed it in the cash drawer, and handed me the hot dog. I could not believe it, did that just fucking work?

"Get out of the way!" a woman behind me yelled as I realized i was staring in disbelief at my hotdog.

Today is going to be fun.
