So, I'm a tiger and the king of the jungle (12 male). 

I am feared throughout every corner of my jungle kingdom and I think overall I've been doing a pretty good job. 

Like my father before me (killed him in ritual combat obviously), I have upheld the ecosystem, culled the weak ones in the food chain and kept the upstart wolves and monkeys in line with the appropriate amount of fear and violence.

I've been pretty lax when it comes to legislation. I'm a bit of a libertarian. There are only really two rules:

"Respect the water truce" and "No god damn humans in my jungle".

Now, guess what.

Those flea-ridden wolves got themselves a human!

Only TWO rules. One, two. 1, 2. Two rules!

Even wolves can count to two, right?

So anyway, I tell 'em to hand that thing over or I will come and murder them all. I even gave them an ultimatum. You know, I don't HAVE to do that? Give 'em a claw and they take a paw.

To cut a long story short: the wolves let that human run away before I could come and get it. The AUDACITY!

Now I plan on getting out there and murder anyone who gets in my way of hunting that human down. Am I the asshole here?
