“First off, how *dare* you insult my skills,” I replied, thoroughly offended at what I’d just heard. Clearly, this king not only was an imbecile, but lacked the intelligence and sophistication required into 
concocting the perfect poison. Why, this was simply unacceptable! 

The king shrugged. “I’m just saying-“ he started. “You might want to tweak your recipe. Thanks for the lovely drink by the way. I’ll cherish it for the rest of my long, long life.”

Now he was just getting on my nerves. That was clearly a jab at me, and I wouldn’t stand for such utter flippant disregard of my abilities. 

“Alas your majesty, I’m afraid you might be right,” I said with a reverent bow, ducking my head to hide the smirk I couldn’t hold back. “However, you lack one important, *fatal* detail.”

“Oh, and what is that?” The king asked with an eyebrow raise and amused chuckle. 

He wouldn’t be laughing for long, though.

I straightened my back, a serene smile replacing the knowing smirk. 

“Just give it some time to sink in.”
