**Unknown ship,** I am Egox-I-Etherable, of the noble standing Laureate, and I am the maintainer of this section of the FTL network. You have fallen into this sector’s Central Gravitational Junction, and if we do not remedy this error, you will be crushed to death in around 39 years. 

**This** is April, your Jumpstander. April retrofits STL ships for a living. You might know her as a “privateer”, but that is an... ungenerous term. 

It is a … simple job. She pops up next to a ship (like yours), that may as well be from the middle ages. I lock and disable their systems (like yours are now), and she straps an FTL node onto their hull (as she will with you). 

There is ... one problem: FTL nodes are costly. Under contract from the Egox Confederacy, April has the legal right to take compensation for her work. Any STL ship clogging the jump lanes is breaking the law. 

And that, dear child, is where we come to *you*. Your ship is breaking the law, as are all of its passengers. 

More pressing, however, is that others cannot use the lane as long as you block it. According to our records, your ship left at a time before the corruption. No ship as old as yours can overpower the pull of the Central Junction. We must either equip you with a node, or hasten your path towards crushination. 

April’s question, which I deliver, on her behalf, is:

“What can you offer in return for something so valuable as an FTL node?” 

Now, you’re lucky you have me to moderate- otherwise April would be stripping your ship right now, as is common in the outer systems, to which you crawl. You don’t have conception of how expensive an FTL node is, or what it is for that matter. I will tell you what you have that is of value to the Egox:

Your personnel computer has divulged a list of human cargo in your holds. I see that you have pre-corruption genetic material aboard. Specifically, 8 children, located in berths: A2, C18, Q99, B23, D18, L12, R67, and… D22, almost missed little Elizabeth. Eject these berths now, and our business here will be done.

I see that you’re activating maneuvering thrusters to stabilize the ejection. You do not need to trifle with this, April has your ship firmly secured.

April has informed me that you’ve launched… torpedoes? Tsk, tsk, child. Torpedoes are not berths A2, C18, Q99, B23, D18, L12, R67, and D22.

Your action is futile. See how they lack the thrust to even approach April's ship?

One moment…

I’ve been authorized by Egox-I-Elk, of the noble standing Poet, to allow you a second chance. Be warned, This is a rare opportunity, do not squander it. 

I see you have ejected berths A2, C18, Q99, B23, D18, L12, and R67. Will Elizabeth not be joining us? Where is D22? 

**Unknown ship**, please respond. 

…

**Unknown ship**, please cease maneuvering. 

…

**Unknown ship**, this is your final warning. Cease maneuvering and eject the remaining genetic material. 

…

I see that my instructions to your life support to vent your internal atmosphere has not dissuaded you from resistance. I, Egox-I-Etherable, of the noble standing Laureate, Hereby authorize the use of lethal force to obtain your remaining contraband genetics. 

…

**Unknown ship**, your reactor shielding has been pierced. If you do not eject D22, Elizabeth will die with you. If you eject D22, she will live a full life, you have my word as a Laureate.

… 

April has confirmed receipt, Thank you.

And goodbye.
