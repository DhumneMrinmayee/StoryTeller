"He did it again Chief. He has some kind of magic going on with his mind." "Yeah but have you actually stood outside the room and heard his mumbling the entire time? It is freaky"

Just regular things people say about me when I'm working. I'm the world's best when it comes to autopsies. I actually have no idea how to actually do one, but it doesn't matter. I just ask the recently deceased to tell me as much about their last few hours as they can and once they freeze up with a puzzled '...and then here I am' I know the last sentence is the cause of death.

The real trick is how I 'avoid death' as the local newspapers constantly report when I go around and needless to say murderers tend to try and prevent me from doing my job. But you aren't dumb since you know about my magic surely you know that every bullet doesn't miss me, and the knife wounds aren't superficial. I'd say this is our little secret but you won't be reporting on this. Sorry, but you arrived on scene to quickly for that DUI accident last night but at least the explosion was quick right?
