"Fortunately, we have known his identity for some time, and-"

"WHAT. WHO IS IT? CRUSH HIM! CRUSH HIM! CRUSH HIM!" Creamy Honeypuff drastically broke protocol and interjected.

"In good time. Anyway, as I was trying to say, we entrusted Private Bloodgore to feed our mole misinformation. Private, you have done exceptional work, and will be promoted accordingly. Now, as for the identity of the-"

"GET ON WITH IT, WHO ARE WE GOING TO TEAR LIMB FROM LIMB?" a puddle of drool and spittle formed at the table in front of Creamy Honeypuff.

"...The mole is Lieutenant Organsmash. And please, let's have some discipline in the war room, C-H-P".

"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?"

"...I... I don't like to use that term here"

"SAY MY NAME, COMMANDER"

"C- ... *creamyhoneypuff"* He flinched in discomfort at the sound of himself saying the term.

"THAT'S BETTER. WE ARE BLOOD DEATH SQUAD. WE KILL AND CRUSH AS WE PLEASE. WE DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING ANYBODY A **CREAMY HONEYPUFF** IF THEY PISS US OFF ENOUGH"

The other members at the table tensed up at actually hearing somebody yell the term.

"IN FACT, I SAY WE GIVE THE **TRAITOR** A BIG FILLED TO THE BRIM **CREAMY FUCKING HONEYPUFF**"

The Lieutenant burst into wailing and dropped to his knees. "Please, No! Not the creamy honeypuff! Please, hang me, draw and quarter me, but not the creamy honeypuff!"

"...Now, I'm as brutal a killer as any," began General Visceral, "But we must have some standards, C-H-P, I mean, Creamy... Honey... Puff. Can we not just eat him alive as is standard procedure?"

"SHOW HIM NO MERCY, GENERAL"

A long uncomfortable moment passed in the war room, punctuated only by Lieutenant Organsmash's sobs.

"Very well, we will make an example of him. Get the knives, get the bees, get the pastry bags, we're going to perform the cursed ritual."

"SAY IT"

"We're going to perform... the creamy honeypuff"
