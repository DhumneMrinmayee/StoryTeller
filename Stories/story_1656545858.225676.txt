I still remember the day it broke. It was the first day of The Age of Honesty. The news was hard to miss. Every newspaper, smart-phone and TV had it and nothing else. Folks in many countries got Presidential Alerts on their phones informing them of the unescapable consequences of conflicted promises.

&amp;#x200B;

For many it was a sense of relief. The recent spate of inexplicable accidents and illnesses were no longer a mystery or a potentially new disease. Several countries that had gone into a state of heightened war-preparedness, were able to step back from the brink.

&amp;#x200B;

People's focus very quickly turned to solving the problem of billions of comatose and quasi-comatose people scattered about. The discovery was clear: there was no escape. Those lost would never return. Many were only partly-comatose because their promises did not completely contradict each other. Some even tried to de-conflict their promises unsuccessfully and slipped further down the slope towards vegetation.

&amp;#x200B;

In some countries, the rising medical costs forced the authorities to abandon completely and mostly-comatose people near forests, hoping the wildlife would help themselves. In other places, laws were quietly passed allowing medical experiments and organ extractions.

&amp;#x200B;

The slightly-comatose were judged by most and relegated to menial and usually dangerous tasks. Debates on the ethical and moral implications of this were usually soon overshadowed by the enormity of a new existential imperative, and how might humanity evolve to survive the calamity of consequential covenants. Experts reassured survivors that hundreds of millions apparently being left completely unscathed was evidence of human evolution that had somehow already happened. Sure, the functional human population had been reduced by over 90%, but those fully alive would probably get to live long happy lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, politics changed dramatically. There were no more elections. There was no more need for them. People feared another coma-causing epidemic of karmic proportions and did little to stray from the path of basic human decency; thus requiring little or no policing or governance. There was plenty of everything to go around, and money was soon passe due to its promissory connotations.

&amp;#x200B;

With the exception of some fringe elements briefly making a Russian roulette-like sport out of making promises, promises themselves became rare and were reserved to weddings and oaths, many of which ended on the spot.

&amp;#x200B;

When statisticians eventually tallied the scores, the results were kept hidden for a generation. We learnt why eventually. It turned out people who didn't keep promises were unaffected; only the ones with conflicting promises went comatose. When this news broke, The Age of Honesty quickly turned into The Age of Evil. Many had hoped a generation of honesty would breed honesty. They were wrong, it bred fools who fell when evil and deceit found a way and steam rolled the na√Øve in much the same way we had left the comatose by the wayside a generation ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The coma of contradicting covenants was our final curse, for the evil were beyond curses.
