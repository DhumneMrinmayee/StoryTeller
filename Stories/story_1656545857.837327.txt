"This should be easy" the adventurer thought to himself as he closed his questing journal, "After all, I can kill a dragon with just one swing of my sword. What's one little cat?" Little did he know, the adventurer was embarking on his final quest.

The cat was said to frequent a place due North of the farmer's house. Somewhere called called the Garden of Nip by other travelers. Having previously visited the site, the adventurer checked the wind, noted the position of the sun, and started walking due North from the farm.

After a few minutes of walking, the adventurer could see the far North border of the farmer's land. The Wall was made of stone, but had what looked like a tan bread loaf propped up on it. Walking closer, the farmer could see sitting proudly and plumply on the wall was a cat. 

"Is this THE cat?" thought the adventurer. "Yes, I am the cat you are looking for" said a voice inside the adventures head.

The adventurer thought that was good enough, so he smoked some weed, gave the cat some cat nip, and chilled like a villain. Being in a very relaxed state, the adventurer promptly fell asleep, and the cat crawled into his lap and followed suit.

When he woke up, he was typing his memoirs on Reddit with a beautiful, tan cat in his lap.
