"Thanks for getting me a drink. That shitty bartender wouldn't let me buy one," Karen said, reaching for the bottle. "Name's Karen by the way."

"I believe in freedom of choice," the other woman replied. "My name's Anna." She watched in amusement as Karen started swigging the entire bottle down. "Honestly, I'll never understand why human beings like alcohol so much. The taste is terrible."

Karen chuckled. "You don't drink it for the taste, silly. And aren't you human too?"

Anna paused before slyly winking. "And if I told you that I wasn't?"Â 

"I would think that you're tripping even harder than I am right now," Karen said, laughing. "What, are you going to tell me that you're one of those otherkin people?"

"Oh no, nothing like that. I'm a real mimic."

"A what?"

"A mimic. Think of it like a shapeshifter with a appetite for human flesh."

Karen gave Anna a amused look. "Oh, and why are you telling a random stranger your secret, mimic?" she said, playing along.

"Just boredom, I guess," Anna sighed. "It gets lonely sometimes knowing that you might be the only mimic left. And besides, it's not like anyone's going to believe you."

Karen laughed. "Well, I can't disagree with you there," she said, her words slurring together. "And here I was worried that you were planning to eat me."

Anna smirked. "Lucky for you, my job at the clinic gives me enough food to eat." She looked at her watch. "Speaking of which...I have a appointment with a patient soon." She stood up from the chair and waved goodbye to the pregnant woman. "Farewell for now. I hope we see each other again soon, Karen."
