**AITA for destroying my Dad's company?**   


 I (23M) have had a rather tumultuous relationship with my Dad (45M). He left my mum before I was born and we didn't reconnect until recently.  I had the opportunity to see where he works and met his boss (88M) who struck me as rather controlling and a bit of a narcissist. Long story short my Dad's boss offered me a job, but I turned it down. He then threatened to ruin my future but my Dad stepped in and there was a fight. Now my Dad's boss is dead and I can't help feel a little responsible. AITA?
