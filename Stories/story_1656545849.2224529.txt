The armored knight slowly shuffled towards his stall. He moved so slowly that Law wondered if it would have been faster to crawl.

"What can I ge-" Law didn't even get to finish his sentence before the knight pulled out a veritable assortment of goods out of his bottomless box. There were two axes made of diamonds, a sword that perpetually gave off cool mist, six sets of black armor and enough scales, bones and massive teeth to dwarf his stall.

Law sighed and looked through his pouch, he found 3 copper pieces and a silver piece. Emptying the contents of the pouch on the table, Law stared at the knight and waited. After a few seconds the knight swept the coins off the counter then bolted down the road at breakneck speed. 

Even though he worked this stall for 10 years, very few people buy the apples he was supposed to be selling. Instead they would just come to his stall and dump all their junk onto him for whatever he had on hand and sometimes when he had made no profits that day they would just leave their stuff on his counter and leave. He would have loved to get rid of these items and maybe turn a profit by selling them but he figured it would be a waste of time to even try. After all, how could a couple of overly gaudy and impractical looking weapons and armour sets be worth anything? Especially if adventurers were willing to sell them off to him for a few coppers.

Law stared at the mountain of junk Infront him then back at his unsold apples. He had barely made enough money to survive this month and now things were looking grim.

"Fuck it, I'm tired of this shit. Maybe I should go adventure too then maybe I'll actually make some money selling all my worthless junk to some lowly fruit vendor."

Picking up one of the swords he bought he read the inscription on the blade 

"Whomsoever takes up this sword shall wield power eternal but just as blade rends flesh so too must power scar the spirit".

His vision blackened and he succumbed to unconsciousness
