Channel 8 news was covering the protest against Whiplash for revealing his struggle with depression. A crowd formed, unexpectedly turning against the popular hero.

The camera zoomed in on a man in the front holding a sign that said "WHIPLASH IS WEAK!" The camera turned away but several screams caused it to jerk back.
The Grave, had risen out of the ground, in his customary  black armor. 

In one hand The Grave held the protestor off the ground, strangling him. 

"Whiplash could break my grip," The Grave said. "Why can't you?"

The Grave turned and addressed the crowd, still holding  the protester by his throat.

"All of you! Whiplash has saved your lives from me more times than I can count.

"I may be a villain but you are the monsters who tear down the one person who can protect you. It would be justice if he didn't come to save you."

The Grave killed at least a dozen people in the minute it took Whiplash to arrive. When he did, The Grave immediately stopped. 

"You do good work. Without you, this city wouldn't last a week. I'll take a break for a while so you can take some personal time." The Grave said. Then he sank back into the street.
