A panicked scream of "Is anybody here a doctor?" You tentatively raise your hand. "I'm a Necromancer, if you're willing to wait a few minutes." The person who called for a doctor looks at you with a mixture of horror and relief, and nods. "Thank you." You step away from the person and begin to raise the dead, feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation. You've never had to use your powers for something like this before, and you're not sure if you're doing it right. After a few minutes, you have a zombie standing in front of you. The person who needed a doctor looks at the zombie with wide eyes. "What the hell is that?" "It's a zombie," you reply. "I'm going to use it to try and heal you." You focus your power on the zombie and attempt to transfer some of its life force into the person. You're not sure if it's working, but the person does seem to be looking better. "Thank you," they say weakly. "I think it's working." You nod and stand up, feeling a little more confident now. You've never done anything like this before, but it seems like you might have actually helped someone.
