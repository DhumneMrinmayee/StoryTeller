After all, for an eldritch god of terror such as him....her...themself, they were not used to writing legally binding documents with mere mortals. And yet I had the ace up my sleeve, the ability to publish to the whole world the phrase known only to his supreme followers for summoning him. Sure, the last member of the cult of H̴̢͇͋̽e̴̟̺̖̿ ̷̙͎͗W̸̼̿h̴̳̫͗͐͛͜o̷̧͇̙͋̊ ̶̫̝̈́̾̆C̶̪̣̼͑ọ̸͉͋̐̐m̷͕̩̤̄̂e̸̜̋ś̴̭̰̠ who knew how to summon him died well over 2 thousand years ago, but alas that didn't stop the army of monkeys from conjuring it up out of thin air.

"Absolutely, I think I require something period appropriate."

"Very well then, Shakespeare, begone with you, and never summon me again."
