Ulfir rose. His job was not done yet.

The low gravity of space did not suit his body, and the nausea was getting to him, but he still had to finish what he started. Ulfir walked around the asteroid, placing charges at precise locations.

Ulfir placed the last charge, and faced his planet. It was a beautiful planet. He wished he had more time on it.

Ulfir thought of his daughter. How she would now be losing a father, in exchange for her life.

The decimated asteroid landed. Tsunamis hit multiple countries, but the rock-giant aliens of planet Roccia were safe, thanks to the explosives that Ulfir placed on the asteroid. His body was recovered from the sea.

Engraved on Ulfir's body were the words: "Thank you for saving our species. Your sacrifice will be honored for eternity"

"The very galaxies will know of his sacrifice"

With many aboard weeping, the starship jettisoned Ulfir out into the great unknown.
