I am a dead man. I tell no tales.

By contract, I am not allowed to communicate with others. My tongue has been cut out and I cannot learn sign language. Yet, a small loophole has presented itself, allowing me to write; and since contracts cannot be changed, the powers that be must let me.

The gift I am blessed with will come in handy today, it seems. Before me lies a soon-to-be dead man, having a seizure. He will be dead in precisely twenty-seven seconds. Beside him sits a frantic woman, screaming for help. I do not move from my spot on the bench.

The paramedics will arrive in two minutes - far too late. The woman's panic worsens as she sees her husband's life fade. In five seconds, he will be dead.

I make my way through the crowd as the dead man begins to pass into the next realm. The woman is in shock and does not notice me. I close his eyes and begin performing my magicks.

His soul is there - in the vortex, descending into the afterlife. I cannot allow this to happen. With a clench of the fist and a flick of the wrist, I wrest his soul from the stream into my palms, before placing it back within his heart, where it belongs.

With a gasp, the man returns to the living. The crowd has dissipated at this point. The woman, beyond belief, asks my name.

But I am a dead man, and I tell no tales.
