70,000 cycles ago, 


humanity, a species so evil and so terrifying that the entire galaxy banded together to destroy them, they enslaved half of the sentients until the rest decided it was enough. 

It was a really difficult task, as they are the ones who have unlocked the secrets of faster-than-light travel. 

It took all the might of the galaxy to defeat them. But there is a catch that genocide was forbidden, even they could not be fully killed. 

But if they die because Earth, their planet, was a frozen hell world, it wouldn't be our fault. So the last 20,000 remaining were sent back to their frozen world. 

But before their downfall, as a last act of defiance, they destroyed all of their technology and research so that no one could travel faster than light, not theirs. 

As the ages passed, the fleets that guarded their world went away, after 10,000 years they did not return to the stars, until they became just a myth. 

The species that defeated them died or left the galaxy, and only myth existed. A reminder of what can happen. 

In all that time, only the myth of them and faster-than-light travel remained. Just a myth. 

Until the signal was received, at all frequencies from the location we plotted to be your original planet: 

"Is anyone out there?"

 But what scared us was the rest. 
"We're Humanity from Earth and we've figured out how to travel the stars and we enjoy meeting every other species."
