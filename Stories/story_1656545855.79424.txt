Some get the power of speed, moving faster than electronics could even process, and the human eye could ever possibly hope to track. Others granted with the powers of great strength, setting weightlifting records and simply maintaining the lies that their extensive training is the reason for their superhuman strength.

But for I?

I can make very few excuses and even fewer are even believable.

My powers are ones that will not grant me any grand medals or give me any thunderous applause of joy nor jubilation.

Because my blessing is a curse delayed. 

The powers of Death itself.

Seeing and collecting the souls of the deceased every waking moment of my life, ensuring they went to their proper places in the afterlife…

I had only two conceivable options for me and neither of which were easy on my mind or my own spirit.

I became a Funeral Director as my day trade, having to tend to the bodies while also insuring the spirit was also properly taken care of.

Unfortunately, just because my shift was over did not mean my ‘duty’ was done with me.

I spend many hours wandering around cemeteries and the city, finding those that have become lost and guiding them back to where they should be, listening to the grievances and grudges that tether them, having to convince them that it is time to go…

It is something I take no pleasure in, especially when one of those souls turned out to be the woman that I once planned to ask on a date..

She was never scared of me or my powers, in fact, she possessed abilities that healed and even helped me at the funeral home some times when I became…overwhelmed.

Something in me wanted to let the lie fall, rid myself of these pretenses, and just allow myself to slip into the shadows….

Yet, I know that’s not what she would have wanted, she tells me such almost daily since her spirit seems attached to me..
