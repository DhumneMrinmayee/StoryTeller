Honestly my first instinct was to turn around and walk back out. I had just come down for some water, it was 3 in the morning and I was more than ready to go back to bed. Rosco looks proud of himself like he understands what he accomplished. I blink at the strange smokey being. He's tall and imposing, but his smile is friendly. He bows again, looking like his dream has always been to grant the wish of a dog. Rosco looks at me with wide eyes as though asking if he is really worthy of a magical wish.

"He is not allowed to wish for infinite treats." I warn and head back up to bed
