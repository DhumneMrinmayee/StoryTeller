PART I:  How Phin Pharmer Became And Adventurer.

===================================================================

"And what makes you think these 'Pan Apples' would sell more than a good, old fashioned Granny Smith or a Red Delicious?"

Because they are the ultimate ingredient in making love potions and happiness," said the old, toothless adventurer.

Phin rolled his eyes. These adventurers never stopped. Unfortunately they knew he was an easy touch. Every day, he traveled from the family farm to the city gates, selling the fruits and vegetables that his family had been growing since his grandpa followed around his own grandpa. His family was already well established with their farm, having cleared away enough monsters to feed a rather large army. Oh, the monsters still came around, but they were harder to trap as their numbers were nothing like what they were a few centuries earlier.

"You know those love potions don't really work."

"No, Phin, they DO work. Look at your Maw. You're blessed that you took after her side of the family. You gotta admit, your Paw does not have a pretty face." Phin nodded. He'd seen the proof at the tavern when his father, Phrag, took him in to celebrate his coming of age. The tavern had an eight-day clock that ran on magic. The tavern owner paid a good price for it, so the tavern always opened up on time and, likewise, shut its doors for the evening. Well, that and the lewd pictures that adorned it. The pictures brought the male customers in, and the clock told the owner when they had to leave. A good, symbiotic relationship.

Phrag usually just knocked on the back door and bought a jug to take home with him. On the rare occasions he chose to spend money inside, he wore a mask. On Phin's coming of age, Phrag gotinto a fist fight with a teamster as the owner started the closing procedure. A right hook from the muleskinner was enough to send Phrag flying in one direction and his mask another. As he pulled himself to his feet, he heard the owner yell, "All right, That's it for tonight, You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here!" Phrag automatically looked at the clock and it shuddered and stopped with it's face falling to the floor. 

"Dammit, Phrag. You're going to pay for that. It'll take days for the Mage to make room in his schedule to fix that damn thing! That ain't cheap."

Phrag was the origin for the saying, "That person is so ugly, they'd stop and eight day clock just by looking at it?" 

"Yeah, Paw is a bit on the ugly side. It's said we've got some orc blood in our line. So what?"

"Until you were old enough, Phrag ran this stand and he made a good living, don't you think?"

"So, what of it?"

"Remember when you started working here, he had you give out samples of apple fritters to the customers. You notice how most of his customers were women, and, I'll put it bluntly, some of them were outright aggressively amorous towards him. Your maw still makes those fritters everyday, but he snagged her cause he gave her an entire Pan Apple Pie one day. I don't know which came first, you're conception or their marriage, but you were born on their nine month anniversary."

"The Pharmer Family has been using these apples to get the best looking women so that eventually they'd breed out the ugly. It finally worked with your birth. 

"That sounds like a bunch of bovine fertilizer!"

"You think so? I can prove it to you. I'll have your sister beg you and Phrag to let her marry me."

Phin did a double take. While the toothless old man wasn't as ugly as his father, Phrag, There was no way Phylicia would marry someone like him. After all, she'd set her eye towards Cary, the cobbler's son.

"Bring your sis to help you tomorrow. Have her handle the money, while you pass out the fritter samples. I'll stop in and bring lunch."

Then next day, with his sister on the cashbox, Phin learned two things. Being able to take care of the customers was more efficient if he only had to focus on that, and two, Phylicia manning the cash box didn't fall for a woman trying to talk her down on prices. Their take for the day was about 150% of any other day that they sold out. And they did sell everything by midday.

They were just packing up their equipment as the adventurer arrived. "Leave the tent up for a few and we'll have lunch." Phylicia looked at the man and Phin saw the look of disgust on her face. There would be no way that she would ever think of marrying this man. He produced the agreed upon meal that included cheese smoked meat minotaur meat, and small individual pies, with fruit juice to wash it down. "I was going to bring some wine, but I didn't want the lass to imbibe before your trip back home."

As they ate, Phin noticed something: Phylicia slowly started smiling at the adventurer as he started regaling her with tales of his work. By the time she's eaten the last crumb of pie, she was looking at the old man with adoration. As they stood up, she took his hands in hers and thanked him for the meal, and asked if he'd like to head back to the farm and join them for dinner that evening. He agreed, and they finished packing up the tent for the trek back. As the cart was too small for all of them, the adventurer, on Phylicia's request, rode on the seat next to her while Phin walked, leading their horse. 

"It looks like I'm going to have a brother-in-law that is not a cobbler," he thought as they headed down the well beaten path to the lane that lead to his home.
