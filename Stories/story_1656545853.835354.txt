" I swear to God, if he doesn't get over his obsession with Lady Darkness, that's it. I'm gone."

That was me. Wildside, 2nd banana to the greatest hero in the city, Naturion. Spending whatever time I have (which wasn't much, by the way) at Irwin's, this nice little cafe in the park, venting about my day to this really nice girl, Louise.

"Hold on. His obsession?"

"Yes, he always thinks that she's "up to something." and I'm like "dude, get some sleep." and he's always like "justice never sleeps" and it is driving me crazy.

"Yeah, for all he knows, she's probably planning a movie night."

"Exactly, I keep telling him this, because there's been an all time low on crime, but he just won't listen.
"That's what she wants you to think" and every time, every single time, every bloody damn time I have to be the one to remind him that Lady Darkness is behind bars and I am sick to death of it!"

"Woah. Has anyone ever told you that you might have anger issues. I mean, it's justified, in your case, what with you doing the same thing over and over again."

"I know."

But then, it clicked. Salmon-coloured hair, wings on her head. She was Frogmouth, Lady Darkness' sidekick.

"I know this might be a bit sudden and I understand if you don't want to, but do you want to help me to put an end to this?

"Honestly, I thought you'd never ask."
