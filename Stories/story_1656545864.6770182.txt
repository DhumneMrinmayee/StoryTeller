\[POEM\]

Standing tall, with new support, I ventured out to change

the zoo that I was raised in, full of lice and mange.

I had these newfound powertools, augmented optics, powered brain.

But even if without them, I could see the world had changed.

You see, time wrought on, and power shifts

And now it's *my* people who need the lift.

So I'll rock on, destroy this verse.

I'll take what they think so great, and make it profoundly worse.

All in all, the plight of them, won't bother me a tick.

As long as I stand free and see the stars, I've done the trick.

Life support networks be damned. My goal is set in stone.

When every other bastard's dead, I'll be at last free,

 and alone.
