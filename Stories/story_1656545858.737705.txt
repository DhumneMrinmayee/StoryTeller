Clamoring, whispering, shouting. The clinks of glasses and dull hum of music people are barely listening too. People of all sorts gather to forget, remember, or lose track all together. Each person unique, for better or worse, but tonight 3 individuals find themselves forming an odd tangential kinship. 

"Precision!" They all shout at the same time, though in the bustling Dive Bar it might as well be a whimper.

"Aye, aye it's nay on impossible to state there's anything more important to what can only be described as...." Started a man with a dark jacket, fit tight, and a darker presence. Following their joint exclamation, but being cut off.

"Art!" Continued a well kept fellow sheepishly, holding his glass as if it would shatter with the slightest pressure. "Y-... you could get lost in the experience. When ev-v-verything flows right the sensation is..."

"Potent." A third, more ragged fellow, stated flatly. His movements seemed as loose as his unkept hair, but his words were firm. "The right time, the right place, the right subject for you to devote your focus. It's like there's nothing else in the world."

"If only for a brief time." All three finished together, sharing a knowing glance, a friendly nod. They finished their drinks, said their farewells, and departed. 

The brooding man, heading north. 

The timid man, gingerly headed south.

And the disheveled man... simply disappearing.

The first clutching his Camera.

The second shakily holding onto his AA token.

And the third gripping the air, not having to hold his gun to feel the rush come back to him.

All of them unique. All of them similar. All of them wishing for one more perfect shot.
