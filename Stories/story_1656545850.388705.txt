"Okay. Roll for Initiative."

***11. 3. 19.***

"Alright then Kel'amal, you're first."

"I choose Diet Coke from the vending machine and use my perk Computer Error In My Favor"

"Alright then, perk says to roll a d20, no modifiers."

***12.***

"You fail the skill check and only receive one Diet Coke in exchange for one dollar."

"Damn, better luck next time."

"Alright, my turn. I select Fanta from the vending machine but I use my special forged dollar bill in lieu of a real one."

"The machine rejects your forged dollar bill."

"Seriously??? You keep rejecting my forged bills Vexixial what was the point of crafting the item in the first place?"

"I told you your crafting skills weren't high enough to produce a convincing forgery. Now are you going to select a drink or not?"

"Nah, I'll pass. Gummar, you're finally up, what're you going to do?"

"Punch."

"Gummar, this is a vending machine, not a cashier. You can't stick up a machine."

"Punch."

"Uh, okay then Gummar, we go with Punch. It's a static object so you're guaranteed to hit, roll for Damage."

***20.***

"You smash a massive hole in front of the machine where the "Pepsi" selection used to be. The entire machine swings open revealing dozens of soda cans to you. However, the massive damage triggers the built-in security system of the machine and alarms begin blaring."

"Damnit Gummar, we JUST got out of jail! Mister "Oh So Perfect" World Master here made us sit through an entire special "Prison" encounter dungeon where we couldn't level up or get any dollars in!"

"But me likey Punch."
