Imagine, for a moment, that some superintelligence had access to your entire being. Something that could read your brain, manipulate your senses. Something that knew everything about you and could feed you a stream of information, could hack your nerves, to create the most mathematically pleasing sensation possible to you. The most beautiful scenery, the most rapturous soundscape, the most attractive mate.

That is what human food is.

All carbon based lifeforms share similar traits. Evolution took separate paths on our separate planets, but we all have things in common. In particular, we all had similar tastes. No matter what planet youâ€™re on, glucose or other sugars will be a valuable source of energy. Sodium will always be a necessity, so savory foods will always be delicious. But for all our species, we turned our intelligence towards providing the necessary nutrients for ourselves. Humanity turned theirs towards hacking the senses.

They read their own tastebuds and developed artificial sweetners that fit better than sugar. They crammed different flavors together to explode in the mouth. They created combinations that would never had existed in theirs, or any, ancestral environment. And because of our similar evolutionary paths, they hacked our senses too.
