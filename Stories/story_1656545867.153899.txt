I remember the headlines when they first introduced this law.

"Incredibly stupid law guarantees thousands of people not knowing the crime they were locked up for."

The worst part is that the memory erasure was generally hidden from the public, so naturally appeals processes got even messier than they already were. Not to mention that this punishment, much like the death penalty, quite often had false positives, meaning that people were not only being locked up crimes they didn't remember, but also couldn't remember they didn't do.

People forgot families, loved ones, cherished memories, and often were then proven to be false positives anyways. Oh, but here's the real laugh riot, jailed protestors would ALSO get their minds erased. So not only were they in jail for peacefully expressed first amendment rights, but cops would often lie to them that they were violent or vandalized something so they wouldn't fight the charges, and that was completely legal for the cops to do BEFORE memory erasure even became possible.

Fortunately here in the oh so glorious future, they have made it so you can send messages through time into the past. So if you're reading this, people in the year 2022, it's about 10 years before this becomes possible, and when it does, don't let it happen. The legal system is currently a goddamn mess and apparently it's pretty bad in your time too, so make sure it doesn't get even worse. Because it can, AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO.
