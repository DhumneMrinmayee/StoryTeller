"Listen here, you ungrateful brats!"

The words echo through a maze of concrete, asphalt and metal and glass. Purple Poltergeist is angrier than I've ever seen him.

"We work hard!" He shouts. "Four times a week, I build death rays, come up with ingenious schemes that have one critical flaw, and kidnap helpless innocents! And four times a week, *he* is here to save you! Without him, you'd all die in a fire or something!"

"Your plans wouldn't work anyway!" A heckler shouts, cupping his hands around his mouth to project his voice. "Your death rays all self-destruct without any interference!"

Purple Poltergeist's face goes beet red. Now I'm the one stepping in. I float forward a few feet. 

"Listen to me!" I shout. "Purple Poltergeist works hard on those death rays, every day so that you all can have a good show. It's not his fault--he was just born without natural talent. But he *learned.* He applied himself and learned a difficult skill and that's more than any of you can say."

"Shut up, Triangle Man!" The crowd starts booing again. I'm embarrassed and fall silent, but Poltergeist knows me too well.

"It's not a triangle!" He says, gesturing to my suit. "It's a pyramid!"

"That's right," I say, tearing up despite myself. "What is wrong with you people? Why don't you know the difference between a 2D triangle and a 3D pyramid?"

The crowd only boos louder. Purple Poltergeist spits in disgust and floats over to me.

"Y'know what, let's just cancel the show," he says quietly. "Who gives a darn? They don't wanna see it, then maybe we shouldn't break our backs doing it."

"Thanks," I say, wiping my eyes. "For defending me."

"Of course." Poltergeist smiles. "You've always been there for me."
