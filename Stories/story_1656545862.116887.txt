"\[BORED\] We previously briefed your ship-mind that the Solan-Ghhrlan pact, date of signing: galaxy-turn 7728.22837452, obligates both parties to declare war on any entity engaged in aggressive actions against either party after three repeated incidents with confirmed casualties..."

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really listen to the ship-mind's droning translation.

The Solan ambassador wasn't saying anything of substance yet: she was just regurgitating the points that were already in the briefing.

Boring the hell out of each other in person was standard procedure for first contact between civilized races.

It was an ironclad way to make sure that when you found banned surveillance equipment on some "tourist" from another race, their diplomats couldn't say "your ship-mind ate our homework!"

&amp;#x200B;

And boredom aside, I just couldn't focus.

The ambassador's race was so *cute!*

Those bony flower-like hand-tentacles they had, the adorably tiny bodies with oversized eyes, and most of all, that irresistible snoot...

...oh, the Academy did not prepare me for this.

How are you supposed to keep your mind on the job when the race you're sent to deal with has such adorable cutesy-boopsy snoots?

&amp;#x200B;

"\[VERY BORED\] Furthermore, Solan trade law dictates that every planet is independent in the decision to set tariffs, provided that tariffs are set for the entirety of an alien civilization..."

"I have to boop it," I whispered to my partner.

"What?"

"That snoot. It must be booped. It *calls* to me."

There was a long pause. Then, hesitantly, he whispered back:

"It calls to me too."

"But we *shouldn't*," I hissed. "That would be impolite. *They* don't do it to each other, do they?"

"With snoots like that, how could they *not*?.." He sighed. "No, you're probably right. Their briefs never mentioned it."

&amp;#x200B;

"\[BORED\] Do you confirm that you have heard and comprehended the introductory briefing?"

I kept staring at the ambassador's snoot. The temptation... it was too great.

My partner stared too.

It was like we were both in trance.

My whole body shook. I wanted it. I *needed* it.

My will was so terribly weak.

"\[ALARMED\] Do you hear me?", the translator droned.

The Solan had wrinkled her snoot and opened her eyes a little wider when she asked that last question...

...And that was just *too* cute for me.

I *lost it.*

My tentacle uncurled, as if by itself, and landed square on her snoot.

So soft! Smooth and yet not slippery like glass - more like a coast-flower! But as soft as it was, it had a bony core that just made it so *satisfying* to boop!

Then I saw the look on her face.

Shocked, scared... and then puzzled as I booped the snoot again.

&amp;#x200B;

"I take personal responsibility for this misunderstanding," my partner said, pretending to dig through the files in his console. "It appears I have forgotten to brief your ship-mind on our *informal* communication."

I bowed my eyestalks and wrapped my tentacles around me.

I felt so ashamed... and yet there was a warmth to that shame. A warmth that almost turned it into *pride*. It was *so worth it*.

My partner was a better diplomat than I'll ever be. He just kept on bulshitting, calm and collected:

"Booping the other person's snoo-"

He clapped his talking-hole shut, then started again.

"*Tapping* the other person's *nose* is an informal gesture of agreement. It is automatic for us: both of us had to *force* ourselves not to do it. According to the videos you provided, you have a similar behavior... that universal gesture of agreement, moving your head up and down."

"\[PUZZLED\] Do you mean a nod?"

She showed the gesture, and I hastily looked away before the temptation grew too great.

"Yes." His tentacles twitched, but he kept them tightly curled. "I meant *that* gesture."

Then, with genuine hope in his voice, he added:

"I hope you have not found the experience *too* unpleasant? I will repeat: both of us struggle to control the boop reflex. We will install a forcefield if you find boops *completely* unacceptable."

The Solan breathed out, making a sharp sound before talking. I remembered that reaction from their briefing - it was called "laughter".

The ship-mind translated:

"\[ENTERTAINED AND/OR RELIEVED\] No, it was just too sudden. I thought you were attacking me."

&amp;#x200B;

There was a long awkward pause.

None of us knew what to say, now that apologies were given and accepted.

Booping snoots wasn't part of the protocol.

And in that silence, I recalled something odd: all this time, the Solan kept her two hand-tentacles *locked together*.

It didn't look like a relaxed pose.

In fact, it looked a lot like us curling *our* tentacles while we resisted her cuteness.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, she broke the silence:

"\[BASHFUL\] May I boop your snoots in return?"
