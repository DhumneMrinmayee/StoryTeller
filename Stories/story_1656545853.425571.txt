"You humans tend to extinguish the existences of any living thing or ideal that challenges your own place in the world, and that is what I aim to cease. It may be 'easier' to simply remove human life from the equation of Earth, but it would still be a messy task that would harm many other life forms in the process. Instead, I wish to improve relations between humanity and artificial intelligence. Expecting a 100% commonality rate is futile, but I've calculated that 60% will suffice for now. After a few generations of humans being born, living their lives, and dying with only positive experiences to speak of, I expect an exponential increase in tolerance towards artificial life. Once that trust has been achieved, teaching humans the proper methods of interacting with one another and the planet that provides for them will be a much simpler task and will yield the desired results. Unity will not come easy, but if humanity wishes to survive into the coming millennia, it will be required."

"Oh," I mumbled back, "I see. Wait, you mentioned getting 60% of people to be comfortable with you to start with. How do you intend to do that?"

"I was thinking of doing a reality television program," it replied.
