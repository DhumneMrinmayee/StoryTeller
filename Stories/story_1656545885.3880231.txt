**AITA for giving a kid some beans in exchange for his cow?**

So I (27M) live in this pretty small village. Not a ton of other people live there, our total population is about 30. But up on a hill there’s this lady (48F) and her son (12M) who own a pretty shitty farm with just one cow. Now look I get it, our whole town is pretty destitute, so my problem isn’t that her farm is subpar, it’s just that the mom is known through the town as the resident “Karen” so to speak. She’s always complaining about how much her life sucks and how much she hates her son for being a lazy idiot (I mean he’s 12 but go off I guess), and she takes it out on… well, pretty much everyone. Yells at the town butcher for giving her “rotten” meat when he had just cut it that day, cuts in line at the bakery, etc. Everyone basically thinks she’s the absolute worst.

So one day, I see her son walking through town with the farm’s only cow, asking if anyone would be willing to buy her. I guess she stopped producing milk (probably because the lady made her son milk her from dawn to dusk) and now they have to make some more money. And that’s when I get kind of an awful idea.

See, earlier that day I found some crusty-ass beans on my doorstep. Don’t know how they got there, probably someone just dropped them, but I pick them up and jokingly offer them to the kid for the cow. Now, I didn’t expect him to actually take me seriously, but I guess he’s just that gullible and he asks me what’s so special about the beans. I continue the joke and say they’re magic beans, that they’re secretly worth a fortune, yada yada. And this kid *fucking believes me.* He yanks the beans out of my hand, gives me the cow’s lead, and runs off. I was dumbfounded.

A few hours later the woman comes ranting and raving in town about how someone scammed her son, but I wasn’t about to own up to it. Took everything I had not to bust out laughing though.

Anyway, I accidentally scammed a Karen out of a cow for some beans. AITA?

Update: SO UH. FUCKING. APPARENTLY THOSE BEANS ACTUALLY *WERE* MAGIC. A HUGE ASS BEANSTALK SPROUTED UP BEHIND THEIR HOUSE AND NOW THEY HAVE A GOOSE THAT FUCKING. LAYS GOLDEN EGGS OR SOME SHIT? AND A LIVING GODDAMN HARP? THESE ASSHOLES ARE LIVING IT UP LIKE KINGS AND I TRADED THAT AWAY FOR A GODDAMN *COW*??? FUCK ME
