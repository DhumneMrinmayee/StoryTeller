Once I was the most beloved of my *old* Order "Knights of the Shining Light". Long has it been since I passed, at first I thought this some cruel jestby some dark god. To raise me as a corpse to test my faith, but as I looked around and locked my eye with the child barely able to scratch out ritual circles let alone remember the incantations look at me doe eyed with tears on his cheeks did I feel the smallest ember of the shining light still within me. Varidash wants this child protected. *So be it* I thought to myself. my thoughts felt thick, like my head was full with as much dust and cobwebs as grey matter. *One more task for Varidash* his lips begin to move, but no sound comes out. Attempting to move forward to get a better look at his mouth to read his lips I feel the rusted plates of my armor creak and groan but no sound reaches my ears. The child flinches and steps back. *Oh good* I thought to myself *I'm his first undead*

A fool I had been then over the past few decades I have learned a few interesting things firstly what my task truly is is a mystery to me, I find it hard to disobey an order from Tailion however compared to the other undead he raises I have lot more independence. I decide how to execute my orders. This has led to some difficulty early on in our relationship however he has learned to utilize me well, as a trusted friend more than a pawn. I appear not to have been created solely through his magic or it was some lucky fluke that he raised me at all it was several months before he could get a second skeleton to stand. It was almost a year before he could keep a skeleton up for more than a few minutes. While I never faltered. One night in praticular finally warmed my dead heart to Tailion sitting around a campfire sharing a 1200 year old bottle of wine (one of the few things that taste right to me having a rotted tongue) he found looking though long forgotten mausoleums in a drunken stupor he gave me a command I'm not sure he remembers "Could you look out.. for me? Like I know you do already and stuff and I appreciate that don't get me wrong, but like... I mean as a father" I felt a stinging in my eye, and it felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. As I tried to find the words to say "Of course I will my so..." The idiot fell asleep and interrupted me with his snores. Chuckling I placed a blanket over him, letting him sleep.

Stepping away I lock eyes with the brutes guarding the camp 

"Nothing enters this camp save for myself and your master"

All the brutes do a huffy grunting as they spread out making room for me to pass. I continue till I can no longer see the light from the campfire. Pulling my hammer out and pulling my shield off my back I begin preparations to meditate. As I run throughy routine trying to knock the perpetual cobwebs in my muscles out and letting my mind flow I get a vision. I am kneeling naked before a throne made of light to bright to look at. I hear Varidash  speak with a voice of thousands of bonfires raging "**LOOK**" as he spoke the light died down and I could look at him. Still nearly more than a moat of light he spoke softer this time 

"**You travel not with one who deals in undeath you are proof enough of that**" 

"But how, my lord, I have seen the spells he uses the ones to enhance me are no different?"

"**Necromancy is the study on how to manipulate life this covers raising someone from the dead into undeath and back into life, as well as healing and hurting people, but nobody has created unlife before. Tailion could very well be the secret to riding this world of undeath**" 

"How can your humble servant assist you, my lord"

"**Tailion is also getting a vision from me tonight encourage him to see it through**"

"Of course, my lord, whatever you need of me shall be done."

As I come to I feel the full fire of the Shining Light within me. I turn to a nearby tree and bring the full fury of Varidash down apon it a loud crash startles the forest around me awake as I turn from the smoldering tree behind me resolve restored and move back to camp. I had a feeling I knew where we were going next the very same cript I was buried in.
