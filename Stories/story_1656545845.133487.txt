“Next time you make poison, make sure it really works. It was pathetic”

The King thinks I want to kill him. I mean he’s right to make that assumption. My dad did kill his father right after we had our arranged marriage. Now everyone looks at me like I’m some traitor because of the atrocity my father committed. I’m surprised I haven’t been killed my the king as a form of retaliation for his fathers death. I think the king thinks that killing me would be easy so he’s decided to keep me to torture me.

Not like my father would care though. My father hates me. He always wanted a son and to his dismay I turned out to be a girl. Oh and he hasn’t let me forget that I’m unwanted since I was born. This arranged marriage was just an attempt to expand his kingdom.  Lol stupid me thought he was warming up to me. I mean can you blame me I have some obvious daddy issues. I craved for my dads affection so seeing that he wanted to marry his “ugly and worthless daughter” to one of the most powerful kingdoms meant a lot to me. I guess you could say that I am super naive.

The thing is the Cogel  is different. Once a king dies, his queen takes over if the couple does not have any child. If the queen dies, provided she has no kids, anyone of her relatives she assigns in writing could take over the kingdom. It is how this kingdom became one of the greatest kingdom of our time. The constant expansion and addition of clans by marriage and rulership instead of wars. That was my fathers elaborate plan. Kill the king, kill his son before his daughter gets pregnant, force the queen which is me to make him the next ruler in the event of death and then kill me. I must say the plan is smart in a way but also stupid. If I die before the king or I am killed in retaliation he’d never be able to take over. Then again he could use my death as an excuse to go to war with Cogel.

Meanwhile Cogel has the greatest army of earth but it chooses not to go in battle as one of its fundamental beliefs is peace. This is why my husband didn’t go out on a full blown war with my dad’s kingdom. He believes no life is worth sacrificing for some greedy interests. If he killed me and married another person this whole conspiracy by my father would end. Besides my fathers army would be wiped out by Cogel if they tried to go to war with them.

I honestly do not know why I’m kept around. The king thinks I want to poison him everytime I give him a drink. The servants and maids all gossip about me in hushed voices as I walk by. I’m no longer allowed to leave the palace or even tend to my garden. The king no longer shows me affection except we’re in public. My life’s miserable and I think of ending it everytime but I can’t. I worry about the king though. I’m determined to show him that I do care and I’d never betray him even for my father. I wish I could take away all the pain he’s feeling from losing his dad. I don’t know if he’d ever forgive me. I’m very sure seeing me reminds him of what my father did. Nevertheless I’m determined to spend the rest of my life showing him how much I care. It’s gonna take a long while but I think he’s gonna come around.
