&gt;PROMPT: *As you enter your living room, you find your dog, a bottle soaked in drool, and a genie. "Greetings, master of my master" the genie welcomes you*.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A DOG’S WISHES**  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*If you’re going out can you get me some cucumbers on the way?\*” As usual, every time I get out of the house I have to bring some sort of offering to my master: the wife, and if you know what’s good for you, you do not go up against the wife’s word. As I walk out of the house I realize, in my infinite wisdom, I’d forgotten my keys inside the house, for the millionth time, so I walk the walk of shame back into my living room and my little pup is fiddling with one of his toys once again. I get down to pet his cute little head and I notice a little toy that I hadn’t seen before.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*What you got there, buddy?\*” I ask my dog as I pick up the drool-soaked bottle, but then an unfamiliar voice speaks up from behind me, “\*Greetings, master of my master! How may I be of service?\*”  
&gt;  
&gt;I must say, I have never been given a jump-scare as much as that time I heard a voice speak to me in my house that only contains my wife, my dog, and myself. Then I turn around and there he is, in his smug face a hint of acknowledgement of the effect his sudden appearance had on me, sitting on my couch waiting for me to reply to him, or in the very least make any reaction to his presence.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*Genies are real? Wait, no, do I get any wishes?\*” I ask.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*Apologies, master of my master, it doesn’t quite work like that. Master Atlas has already used up his three wishes, and he didn’t wish for you to be able to wish.\*”  
&gt;  
&gt;A huge disappointment for me. I’ve fantasized about finding my own genie lamp my whole life. It’s not really an obsession, just a passing fantasy every now and then… What if I had the ability to change my whole life with just three wishes. But alas, I get it. Then I got curious; “\*Huh? You communicate with dogs?\*” I asked.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*That I do, master of my master. I am able to communicate with any being. That includes humans such as yourself, as hard as your languages are to grasp. A dog is much easier to communicate with, all it takes is four or five different sound combinations and the point is clear.\*”  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*I have too many questions to ask but I just want to know what my dog wished for, if that’s okay with you.\*” By then, my dog had come up to me and started looking at me with intent. I’d never seen Atlas sit so still and stare at me like he understands what I’m saying and patiently wants to hear me.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\*Absolutely, master of my master. Master Atlas’ first wish was to live as long his master. He will live by your side and will not expire until you do.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Master Atlas’ second wish was for you to never feel sadness again, and to live a life full of happiness.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\*And Master Atlas’ third wish was for you to only perceive him as a good boy and nothing else.\*”  
&gt;  
&gt;I turned my eyes to Atlas, his eyes still fixated on me, a happy smile on his little face. I went to him and gave him a really tight hug, realizing at that moment, that humans with all their emotional capacity, could never give up a total fantasy to keep their companion as happy as possible.
