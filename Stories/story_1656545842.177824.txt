"No, I am not willing to wait!"

"I get that! I totally get that, don't get me wrong. Just throwing that out there as an option, you know?"

"He won't be dying! He won't die! He can't."

"I'm... not dead... yet."

"Oh my god you're conscious! Okay! Okay good good. Stay awake! Just keep talking. Listen to my voice and just keep talking to me."

"This... really sucks."

"I know. I know I know. Just hang in there for a it, we've got a doctor coming for you. So just stay still and awake and you will be fine. You'll be fine."

"Is the doctor... that her?"

"Her? No, she is someone else."

"Hello sir, I am a necromancer. I can help you if you let go and kick the bucket."

"He isn't dying!"

"Let's... keep an open mind... here."

"What? No!"

"Sir,  with absolute confidence I can guarantee that being revived is like waking up from a nap."

"Shut up! Just go away!"

"...Like a nap?"

"Yep! Just like a nap! Any differences you feel after revival will be negligible since I can revive you the moment you die. Honestly this is the best possible circumstance, a corpse that has been lying around for a while will be faced with a handle full of complications."

"What..." \*coughing\* "What side effects... will I have... doc?"

"This woman is not a doctor! Have you lost your mind?"

"No... just lost... my legs..."

"Christ, I can't believe you. You're willing to make a deal with an evil worshipping necromancy just because she's right here?"

"That's actually a common misconception, necromancy has no inherent connection with anything evil. The value of a corpse is determined by the culture of the observer. And just for the record, I am a devout reincarnationist."

"Yeah... don't... Don't be... an ass..."

"I'm - I'm not -"

"Your rudeness aside, let's carry on with the discussion about side effects. With such a fresh corpse, the worse you can expect is a little numbness and the occasional chill. Your organs will still function properly, though it will be almost unnoticeable, all bodily functions will be ever so slightly slower."

"I think... I can.. can live with that."

"You mean '*die* with that,' right?... Sorry that wasn't very professional."

"...It was... a good one..."

"I think it is in poor taste."

"Everyone's a critic. Anyways, what will it be sir."

"I'll just... die then..."

"This whole exchange is blowing my mind."

"Necromancy has that effect on people. Hazard of the occupation. Okay sir, you ready? Close your eyes and relax. Walk towards that light you see in the distance there. Just gooooo to sleeeeep."

"You're insane."

"I - I see it... Oh it's so... beautiful..."

"..."

"..."

"..."

"...? Sir? Are you dead yet?"

"Give me... a minute..."

"Right, okay. I'll give you a bit longer then."

"..."

"..."

"..."

"... Alright... I'm dead... now..."

"Finally. Jeez it's always so awkward waiting around for that."

"I have never understood a person less."

"I get that a lot. That's not a necromancy thing that's just a personal thing."

"Just revive him already."

"Already did."

"Why was it my goldfish that I won at a fair as a kid guiding me to the after life?"

"Unpacking that is a bit outside of my scope as a necromancer. I can  recommend you a therapist. He is phenomenal at mind control magic."

"Ooo that sounds perfect! Do you have a business card or a phone number you can give me?"

"I officially do not care anymore. It was... not a pleasure to meet you Ms. Necromancer. It was something but it was not a pleasure. Good bye."

"I get that a lot too. Have a good one!"

"... So about that friend of yours."
