On every television in the city I was broadcasted from my chamber of darkness and shame. People in bars were hollering at the barman to turn the TV up, citizens on the streets looking into electronic stores at the TV displays.. 

"Hello people of New York!" I greeted followed by manic high pitched sniggering. "Today I'm here to educate you in a very spiritual matter.. Make sure you listen because the truth may set you free" I said excitedly as I approached the camera as if it were a person and I was backing them into a corner trying to keep their attention. I realised I was getting too intense in my body language, backed away a bit and paused for composure then suddenly, serious...

"You see Hell is a state of mind, it is something we all experience.. there are people who live tragic lives filled with war, famine, sickness and death but the inner pain they feel is often no more intense than that of a child whose parents told them no" I sighed then theatrically went onto explain..

Our thoughts and emotions are the essence of who we are. It is how we see the World, our purpose in the World, how we interact with it and how it interacts with us.. A man who has undying hope for example will remain optimistic even when the ground beneath his feet begins to open. ANOTHER MAN!! Another man might spend his life trying to do the right thing only to have those he sacrificed everything SPIT in his face" I hissed venemously. "That man may become disillusioned, he may wonder what the point is or he may not but either way that doesn't make him weak that is his experience but here's the interesting part when you step on a man who is down and tried to be good... YOU GET PEOPLE LIKE ME!!!" I screamed and laughed as the broadcast cut out.

The people of the city panicked they know whatever follows a Prince Of Destruction Broadcast is never good. And suddenly a rumble throughout the city.
