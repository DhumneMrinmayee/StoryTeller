This was the dream. A cushy job, perched on a chair behind a counter with as many sweets as I could desire, and an endless stream stream of people giving away their names for free.

The front door opens, prompting the small silver bell to *ding a ling* happily. Maybe I would take the bell when it was time to go. But first, the customer! A young man, smiling politely, oh their name would sell for quite a pretty penny back home!

“Hello! May I have your name and reason for visiting us today?”

The voice that answered was not human, it was too musical and vibrant for this world. I became aware of how empty and quiet the normally bustling entrance was.

“Aw, well you can call me ‘It-That-Acts-On-Behalf-Of-The-Council’, they are very upset with the operation you are running here.”

I froze. This was bad. An Enforcer, here, in broad daylight?

“Well, that’s a very odd name, but I have no idea what you are talking about young man. Is the City Council mad with us? All our paperwork is-“

“You have seven seconds. Your weak lies and flimsy runes bore me.”

I sighed, slipping off my stool and stomping around to the front of the counter. I wasn’t strong enough to fight an Enforcer, especially not one that could afford to be so careless with their words. Their voice dropped to a deep, taunting tone, face splitting into a wide grin.

“Giving up so soon, little one~? And here I had hoped you might be more than a common thief.”

I stayed quiet as they led me outside, the world shifting to the verdant forests of my homeland. It was over, then. A pity.
