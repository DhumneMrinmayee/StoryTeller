*Genies aren't real*, I thought, standing in my living room looking at a translucent, green humanoid with his arms crossed. A wisp of green smoke led from him, down to a slobber-covered bottle on the floor. My thirteen year old bulldog, Winston, panted happily beside the bottle.  
  
"I'm not real?" the genie cocked an eyebrow. "Yes, we can read thoughts, as I read your dog's and granted him his wish. Alas, it's only one wish; you humans always think you get three, but Winston here picked a good one."  
  
"Well, what, uh, what would a dog wish for?" I didn't see any meat, no magical chocolate that wouldn't harm a dog, just Winston, the bottle, and the floating genie.  
  
"You've had this dog for quite some time, haven't you?" the genie asked.  
  
"Thirteen years," I replied. "He's near the end of the line, to be honest. Lived a few years longer than most of his breed. Has trouble with stairs now, can't get on my bed anymore..." *Pees in the house* I thought, then cringed.  
  
The genie smiled. "Yes, they do that. Humans who find us seldom consider that we might be able to alter the past. Where do you think Winston found the bottle that held me? It wasn't in your house." *Hmm*... "He found it somewhere else, in a timeline that now never happened."  
  
The genie was losing me at this point, and I was about to say so. But he continued, "Your dog wished for you." Then he was gone.
