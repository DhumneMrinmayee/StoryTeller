Ever made a stupid comment that ended up being taken serious?

When I suggested we just have someone do a write up on the latest incident and release it as a horror story, I wasn't thinking damage control. I was just having fun. I mean, how could it possibly have been an original idea? Surely someone else had made that joke before.

Turns out someone did. Back in the early 1800s a young Mary Shelley was tasked with spinning the first confirmed case of necromancy into something less scary. Bram Stoker? Worked for us. H. P. FUCKING Lovecraft. That one blew my mind. Turns out that Cthulhu is the PG version of events, holy shit!

Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Ambrose Bierce, Shirley Jackson. Loads more. Not ALL of their works are related to my job, but some of them are.

Of course, I didn't know this when I made the joke, so imagine my surprise when my manager introduced me to The King. I get called into his office for a meeting, and there he is. Stephen fucking King. I'm not one who knows what random writers looks like, but Stephen King has been in so much pop culture that he's an icon. The guy's a colonel!

So now my job is to help Stephen King and his posse of authors. Clive Barker, Dean Koontz, Neil Gaiman, Wes Craven. I even helped out on a Guillermo del Toro film! I'm a background extra - my mom was so proud of me!
