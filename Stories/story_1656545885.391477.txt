AITA for harvesting dwarf treasure? 

I (341 dragon) require piles of gold to sleep on (it’s soft and doesn’t catch fire) and gem stones to swallow (I need stones hard enough to grind calcium rich rock in my crop so I can have enough flammable gas in my fire bladder so I can fly and breathe flame). I always harvest my treasure from dwarf mines. Dwarves mine more treasure than they need which causes inflation harming local economies and if they delve too greedily and too deep it can have bad ecological consequences. Harvesting the treasure and encouraging the dwarves to abandon the mine and settle their swarm somewhere else is good for the dwarfs, the environment and the economy. Breathe some smoke in the mine and they leave. However, recently I’ve read an article by People for the Ethical Treatment of Dwarves saying that taking dwarf treasure is “stealing” and hurts the dwarves. AITA?
