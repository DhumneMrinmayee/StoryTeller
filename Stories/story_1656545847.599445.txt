**"You'd think a centuries-old vampire would have a nice stack of cash,"** Vurmei groused. "How terrible of a business sense do you have to have to be *bankrupt* when you've had two hundred years to invest?"

"And you'd think a vampire hunter would be better at lawnwork," Gwimmelsuk snapped. "How'd you manage to mess up setting up a fence *that badly*? Can't be much different from pounding a stake into a vampire's heart."

"Hey, I wasn't the one who knocked the fence over." Vurmei finished cramming the last of his clothes into his rucksack. "Your aim with that baseball is terrible, incidentally. I would've thought you'd be good with bats."

"Oh, you wanna go there? What, am I making you a little cross?" Gwimmelsuk swept the last of the debris up from the floor and gazed around the empty apartment.

For a moment, the two roommates paused in their quarrel.

"We really got evicted," Vurmei finally said.

"Yeah." Gwimmelsuk awkwardly scratched his head. "Sorry about that."

Vurmei waved a hand. "Not your fault. It was a long time coming."

Gwimmelsuk hesitated, then said, "I know a nice belfry, if you want to crash for a couple days."

Vurmei laughed. "I don't think I'd get along with the typical clientele."

"So we're quits, then."

"It was a good one," Vurmei agreed.

The two roommates finished packing and left, leaving nothing but a smell of dust and garlic behind.
