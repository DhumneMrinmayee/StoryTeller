"Damn... If I go into Minecraft, I may be taking by a zombie. Pokemon won't work, nor Gacha Club. I'm sure as hell I'm not going into Cube Escape. Flappy Dragon won't do me much... That just leaves me with Obey Me.. Not the best option, but between zombies, creepers, and gaint ass spiders, I'm willing to take the risk of demons."

I load up the game and waited. I was unsure on how it will play out, but then, right outside my door, Simon was standing there. I click on the Tasks app of the game in hopes to start a the storyline from the very beginning. It worked to my surprise. I walk through the door and went with the storyline.


It was finally midnight and I know Beel wasn't in the kitchen. I snuck out and grabbed only small things that didn't seem to cost much. I get back to my room and went to the closet door and opened it. Just as I imagined, my real bedroom was right behind it. I walk through the door right before Lucifer comes into my other room. I close the door and exit the game on my phone.
