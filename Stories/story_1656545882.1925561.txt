"You told me you were a genie!"

*"Half* genie," I remind him. I may or may not have underemphasized that word when I first told him, but how else was I going to get into college? The recruitment officers at Sandford are a bunch of jerks, and besides, I was far from the only student bribing my way in, so really they had it coming all along. That's what you get for taking bribes. Being forced to let in fools like me on a free ride in exchange for forty million dollar bills that are all ripped in half. Maybe the bank will let you exchange one ripped up dollar for a crispy fresh one, but forty million? Good luck, buddy.
