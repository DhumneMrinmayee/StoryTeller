For as long as Alicia can remember, doors have always opened by themselves. She does not remember much of her childhood, but she can vaguely recall a few of the castles where her mother and her have lived in. She remembers the vast fields outside of her home and the stables where they kept their horses, as well as the rivers that flow through the dense forests. She also remembers how the old doors creaked almost as if they spoke to her, calling her name to go through them, leading her to a new adventure. She would follow, filling the hollow halls with laughter as each of them opened when she stood near them.

And ever since then, all the doors opened at her command.

Alicia is now seventeen and living away from her mother in the old but beautiful city of Oxford. She studies English literature and spends the majority of time in the library alone where she day-dreams of the day she can go back to her mother and the castles.

One more page to go… she whispers to herself, turning yet another page of one of her literature books. Her phone buzzes in her pocket. It’s her mother calling.

“Hi honey, I hope I’m not disturbing you” her mother says.

“I’m doing fine, just finishing up my book” Alicia replies, tired.

“Happy birthday darling. I miss you very much” her mother says, her voice trembling a little. Alicia’s smile fades quickly. “What’s the matter mum?” she replies.

“Nothing’s the matter, I’m just so proud of you and what you’ve accomplished. Your father would’ve been so proud as well.” She sighs, “I’ve sent you a gift and it should have arrived by now. I will call you later to check up on you, alright?” her mother finalises and hangs up.

Alicia frowns upon hearing her mother’s sadness. It has only been a few years since they last saw each other but no doubt has it been difficult for her mother, as she lost her husband in an unforgettable way. He just happened to be in the wrong place and the wrong time.

Alicia gets up from her designated work space and heads towards the student accommodations, where every door opens automatically on its own. Alicia pays no mind to this and barely notices when the door doesn’t open automatically for other students.

She makes it to her door and picks up the deserted parcel that has been left by her door.

Her door opens automatically as she reads the card that has been included with the parcel:

*To my darling Alicia,*

*It’s time you knew the truth.*

*Love,*

*Mum and Dad*

\- - -

*My dearest Alicia,*

*Today marks eighteen years since you were born. Hence why I have written this letter. I always knew I would die young, but not before we would have met. I feel terrible for leaving your mother and you alone for all these years but I made a promise to her when she was pregnant with you – to never leave your side and always guide you.*

*Do you ever find yourself wondering why doors open on their own when others have to open them by themselves? That was the promise I had made all those years before you were born. I would always guide you my darling, no matter where you go. I am so proud of you and who you have become.*

*Happy birthday.*

*I love you,*

*Dad*
