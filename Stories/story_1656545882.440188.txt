Reliance on routine was always humanity's biggest weakness when it came to the fae. "Hello! Welcome to Dr. Robinson's Pediatrics! May i have your name and the name of out little patient here?" Said with enthusiasm and a smile, in the office of a trusted authority figure and Lilithell barely had to cover up their more fae-esq features. 

The answer always came out in the same cadence, "I'm  Mr/Mrs so-and-so and this is blah-blah. We have an appointment at 'this time'." Then on the way out it was the same. "Have a nice day" Lilithell would say and of course they'd respond "Thank you! You too" the two worst things to give a fae, your name and a thank you. That is why they did it though wasn't it? 

Lilithell didnt know why they seemed to remember the early parts of their first inhabiting. Taking the childs body their queen had made sure came it great supply, removing from it everything that made it human until Lilithell could form it into the perfect suit to take over and have a corporial form again. Maybe other fae did remember and they'd done it so much i no longer bothered them. Either way it went unspoken.

The lingering memories were enough to make them get this job however. Laying claim to as many children as possible, protecting them, to make sure they'd have the chance to grow up. To become to rigid for the other fae to reshape. For after all, while routine was the human's weakness, it at least kept them human.
