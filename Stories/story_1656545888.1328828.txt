"Ok.." she said. Her voice was almost drowned out by the gurgling of the creek which we'd retreated to behind the school. "You promise - right?" She continued. Her eyes shifted to mine, then the muddy bank which we stood upon.

&amp;#x200B;

"Of course," I nodded on at her. It'd taken weeks to convince her. Convince her that this wasn't some ploy. No cameras, no stories, just us and the flowing water.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd first heard it in the quite throws of the morning, before the school had awoken from its nightly reprieve. A voice had floated through the dark lit hallways. It was sweet, but lilting. She'd been softly singing of the sycamore trees. That voice rose and fell like the leaves when they gave into gravity come the change of the season. Truthfully though, the lyrics weren't important. What had captured me was the feeling. Something encapsulated in that voice that expanded beyond the available lexicon we tried to capture the world with. The simple truths of what has come, and what will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd approached slowly, careful not to let my worn sneakers squeak against the still damp floor of the hallways. The janitor was the only other beast which roamed the halls at that time. In silence I'd crept to the one glowing door in the hall. It's soft yellow light had glowed on like the beckoning of a distant lighthouse, leading lost souls to shore. When I got to that doorway, I looked on for a few minutes. Pondered at how something so remarkable could be spawned from a frail young girl who on all other accounts wasn't at all.

&amp;#x200B;

When her eyes had bounced up from the paper that her pencil imparted her thoughts onto, I felt nervous. Heat in my face born along by a heart that pumped in rhythm with her tune. Not knowing what else to do, all I could muster was a smile. My weak attempt to respond to her call.

&amp;#x200B;

In the following weeks, it had taken goading. Convincing a dog who'd felt the boot one too many times that this wasn't a deception. Rather than offerings of meat and milkbones though, we traded trust. Smiles. Whispered secrets that had never passed our lips before.

&amp;#x200B;

She cleared her throat now. Though it didn't make any logical sense, I could swear the water hushed itself. The soft wind that blew through the green leaves of that small oasis calmed its swell. An audience awaited their performer.

&amp;#x200B;

It stared then, sweet like honey joined with the spices and twist of a tea let to steep. Her voice rang off the water and floated through the canopy.

&amp;#x200B;

At first there was only one. A bird trying to mimic her brilliance. Its high pitched squabbling was out of tune and timid. Not long after though, others joined it - reinforcing it, building a chorus. The small feet of squirrels ripped against the bark, not unlike the soft tapping of a drum line.

&amp;#x200B;

There, in the forgotten creek behind Syccarue High, I was witness to something spectacular. The blending of the ageless earth and a mortal soul. The congruence of a world unseen, and a girl unseen by the world. My mouth opened, but I dare not join in. What tongue of man would ever dare interrupt the ballad of nature, or peace granted to a lost child?
