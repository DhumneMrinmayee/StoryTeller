u/deletedâ€“aka [deleted]--is a descendent clan of Anonymous Coward, the one-time prolific poster of bad takes and trolls in the quasi-hallowed forums of Slashdot. Once ejected from the Slashdot forums in 2019, the Cowardly lineage migrated throughout the internet, seeking trusting forum moderators to allow randos to post all forms of yammer and drivel.

[deleted] found their home on Reddit. Today, they can be found throughout the ecosystem, peppering subs with dumb questions, abusive responses, and non sequitirs. Upon spewing their nonsense and eliciting their desired reaction, the posters of [deleted] reveal themselves, leaving them both highly visible and shrouded in mystery for all of eternity.

Or until an EMP wipes out the internet.
