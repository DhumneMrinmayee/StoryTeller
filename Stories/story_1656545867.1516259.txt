The whirring of machinery filled the room. Prisoner #303, also known as Ricard, sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by equipment that would soon erase large portions of his memory. As strobe light filled the room, he squirmed, and his life began to flash before his eyes. Directly outside the room, the memories filled a monitor, to be viewed by a small panel of experts. They all carried notepads and leaned in to analyze the memories of the prisoner.   
  
*“I remember it like it was yesterday, a memory that refused to be forgotten, gnawing at the very fiber of my being. 15 years ago, I realized humans weren’t created equally, and understood just how useless I really was.*   
  
*2007 – The worst year of my life. That spring, my favorite musician passes away. I’d never forget her name. Shanice. Up to that point she’d been the saving grace of my childhood. Through the long nights of my mother and father arguing, the sounds of slamming, and glass shattering, she kept me company. Shanice was always there for me, her song lyrics reminded me I wasn’t truly alone, her voice inspired me. Her music made me feel like I could become something in life. When she passed away, I felt this indescribable emptiness. It felt like my heart had an itch, that I couldn’t reach. So, like everyone else who felt the same way, I took to the streets. I attended rallies. I laughed and played music with all the other fans. I tuned into the live funeral that was on television. Full of jokes and remembrance. I met so many wonderful people celebrating the life of Shanice, I even formed a small club to listen to her music every week. It was only fitting that she continued to look after me even after death, that she gave me the motivation to leave the house more. To get away from home.*    
  
*That Summer, my parents officially got divorced. A conclusion so obvious, I probably would not have bothered to remember it, if not for one detail. I remember wanting to go with my mother. Of the two options she seemed slightly better.  She had a deep appreciation of the arts, I used to trace pictures at school, and bring them home to her hoping for praise. I didn’t truly get along with either parent, but I hoped the mutual love of art would bond us. However, she declined, saying she needed a fresh start, and that I was too much like my father. Posers. When she left us, I remember the fake smile my father wore, pretending to be ecstatic to be stuck with me. A poser through and through.*   
  
*In the Winter, my father passed away. Most likely due to stress and lifestyle choices. The last thing he told me. Don’t remember. Whatever it was, the advice probably would have made my life worse had I follow it. What I do remember is the funeral. My mother couldn’t be bothered to attend, apparently neither could the rest of the world outside of myself. As I sat there in that large church, it struck me how silent it was. A deafening silence, it felt like I might lose myself within my own body.*  
*“Is this what it means to die?”*   
*I couldn’t help comparing Shanice’s death to my father’s. One was a celebration, an appreciation of a beautiful life. Loud, energetic, as vibrant and beautiful as life itself...but this was something different. This was death. This is what it truly meant to die, to have no impact on the world. As I realized no one of Earth would shed tears for my father, I began to cry. Not because of my father’s death, but because of the unbearable silence that filled the space between the walls of me. From that moment, I decided, I would do everything in my power to be like Shanice, and nothing like my father. I would live a life where I impacted people, otherwise I would die someday.*  
*Untalented as I was, my only option was plagiarism. I stole the ideas of those more accomplished than myself and rebranded them as my own. I made a long career of it, infringing on copyrighted works, stealing art from others, remixing songs to make it seem like my own original work. Anything I could do, so people wouldn’t forget about me. Anything so I could avoid that same numbing silence. Eventually I gained a small following, people looked up to me and cited me as their inspiration. It was such a warm feeling to be loved, but it didn’t last long. Eventually the truth was revealed, and ultimately, I lived up to my mother’s words, I became the ultimate poser.”*  
  
These and other memories flashed through Ricard’s head as the machinery continued to whir. As he experienced his whole life a second time, a judge and psychologist decided how much of his memory would be removed to serve as punishment. They decided to remove all memories related to his crime of plagiarism, and all memories outside of 2007. It was a fitting punishment for someone obsessed with not being forgotten to forget himself.
