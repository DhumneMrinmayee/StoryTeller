We were known as the cursed, unable to conjure magic even to that degree of a child. We were shunned and so we fled to the mountains to escape the hate, building ourselves up with machines and contraptions from our own hearts and minds.

The high mage took notice and our humble home was soon engulfed in fire by a thousand of the strongest cinderites the fire college could train, the floods circling the corridors crashing their mighty waves against our fragile machines all from the fingers of the golden waterwalkers of the water college and roots set out to bind our people and keep them in this conjured Hell by the best gardeners of the earth collage. Our home was soaked ash by the time they finished and they returned thinking we had perished like our farms and machines.

But on that day we found our curse was a blessing for as the materials around us ignited we stepped through the flames like water, pushed through the water like leaves and as the roots came to bind us they could not find us. For like a Flagstaff on the high tower we weathered without bending, we were immune to magic but they would not be immune from our wrath.

We built weapons of war, trained ourselves in arts of combat long forgotten and we tamed fire, earth and even water to bend to our machines. We were no longer cursed we were the chosen to rule!

I bear this message to all for those who are like us we welcome you to the fold, to all who would join us no harm will come to you. But know as we tear down your cities and strike our blades deep into your artificer hearts those who harmed us will regret not leaving us alone that day and all will know that cursed name that is: The Chosen!
