I tensed, shifting my eyes towards the guards at the door and expecting to be clapped in irons or killed on spot. The heavy silence that followed made my hair stand on end, the only sound I could hear was my own breathing. 

“Well?” King Lerath said expectantly, as if I had a reply that would make sense of why I would poison my own uncle. As if there was an easy answer. 

Thinking furiously I wondered how I would get away with this, what I could possibly do to fix the situation. The reality was that not only had I failed to poison him properly, but now my own father would ensure I die if his Highness does not. I opened my mouth to end the silence that was threatening my sanity. But before I could form a reply he backhanded me across the face, sending me tumbling to the floor. 

“Fool.” He spat, walking towards the exit of the dining hall. “If you’re the only threat your father has come up with he is not nearly as scary as your Aunt makes him out to be.” With that he exited, and I was alone on the floor. 
What the hell just happened?
