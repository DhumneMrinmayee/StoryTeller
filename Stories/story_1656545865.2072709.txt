There was an account here of fools who trifled with the divine. the True Divine, not the minor things that claim to be.

Cursed swords were never forged by blacksmiths that never were, and wielder by those who never will be. Wishes never made and never granted, and contracts that were unnecessary, for they were delivered onto the demons in an instant.

they were undone in the blink of an eye and forgotten in its wake, for that is what a God truly is. Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent. To go against it is folly, for if it truly wanted you dead, it would simply be.
