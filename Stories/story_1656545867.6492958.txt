Garry looked down at the table, tiny figures aligned on a grid map. Leslie was smiling like an imp "Does 17 hit?" she asked, tapping the orange polyhedron on the table. "Yes but-" garry was interupted "Alright that's 21 damage" she said, turning to Phil who was next in the turn order. "No" garry exclaimed "He's immune to damage from humans, you're playing a human. I just explained this, were you on your phone?" Leslie shook her head "A human didn't attack him, a sword did. If he immune to slashing too?".

Garry sat down, he had been standing for the Warlock's whole monologue "He can't be hurt by humans. You're human. IT doesn't matter what you use" Phil cut in "I'm a half-elf, do I do half damage?" he asked "You're not even there, you're still in the mirror room" garry explained "But it's my turn! Leslie just attacked, can I get out of this room already she's taking on the warlock alone".

"She's not taking on the warlock. Her sword does no damage" Garry raised his hands, the familliar frustration of 1am gaming starting to set in. "So he can't be hurt? That's super against the rules. Why am I being punished for playing a human. Do you have an elf fetish or something?" Leslie accused "No! It's a puzzle, you're supposed to activate the statue, remember? Two rooms ago you got the Pygmalion-amulet that can make statues come to life. Not every encounter is supposed to be a fight" Garry didn't care about ruining the puzzle at this point. Leslie giggled "Haha yeah, I'm gonna make that statue of the mayor in town pick his nose. Anyway how is that diffrent from using a sword? It's still me killing him, I'd just be using a pointy metal thing rather than a golem" she reasoned.

Garry laid his head on the table "Your sword plunges into the Warlock. Who should have worded himself more carefully. Phil iot's your turn" Phil looked up "What? I was on my phone".
