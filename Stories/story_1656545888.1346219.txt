"Mr. Richards. Thank you for coming in," the man said as he sat across from me. Tired eyes, cheap suit, even cheaper cologne... this was a spitting image of a detective. He cast a quick look at his partner, already sat at the table, then returned his attention to me.

I did not respond.

"I understand this is a... difficult time, but it is imperative that we get your statement as soon as possible."

"Could- could you close the window please?" I stammered. The two detectives exchanged brief looks before one got up and acquiesced to my request.

"Mr. Richards, could you tell us what happened earlier today"

"Birds," I quickly replied.

"Is that what killed your friends?" the detective said and looked at the file; it said the injuries that led to the deaths could be caused by birds. It would even explain why they're yet to find their eyes. I nodded.

"And how did that happen? Did they simply swoop from the sky and-"

"It was Viola."

The detective quickly listed through the file.

"Viola Summers? She's the only student we've not been able to find. Was she also hurt?"

"S- she did it."

"Could you... elaborate?" the detective asked; he seemed to be running out of patience for tall tales.

"She's shy. Quiet. Keeps to herself. One day she said when she s- sings, birds come to join her. She wanted to impress us, I- I think, befriend us, but he- Steve I mean-" I had to pause. The detective looked at me curiously.

"Take your time," the detective said.

"He laughed at her. Then Jen did. Then everyone did. Called her na- names. Princess, psycho, loser, that- that sort of stuff. I didn't, but... I didn't stop it either. Then... he pushed her. Took it too far."

A moment of silence followed.

"And then?" the detective asked.

I looked up at him, eyes wide and wild - behind him, outside of the window, sat a raven and looked at me with curious, knowing eyes. Like it knew. Like it waited.

*"She sang,"* I whispered.
