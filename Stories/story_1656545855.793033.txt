**"So... what can you do, power-wise?"** Tanryn gave me a curious look as I paced the vault-room floor.

I looked up, scowling. "Why do you want to know?"

Tanryn gestured at the sealed vault, at the horde of clockwork abominations outside, and said, "You're so confident that you can get us out of here alive," she said calmly. "I still think you're insane if you think you can fight your way through that crowd, and I've made my peace with dying here. But you clearly think otherwise, so... what've you got up your sleeves?"

I gave her a long, considering look. As much as I wished to share the true nature of what I could do with her... no. The knowledge of what I could do—of *how* I could do it—was too dangerous to speak aloud. I was already being hounded by at least one powerful faction for what I knew. I didn't need that knowledge to spread around.

So I lied. "I can make rifts," I said. "I'll pry open a portal back to realspace. Take us back home. No need to fight anyone."

Tanryn pressed her lips together in displeasure. "If you say so," she said.

I sighed. At least she believed me when I said that. Because the true scope of my abilities was much, much more terrifying.

I didn't have the power to open rifts.

I had the power to *give myself more powers.*

If I wanted to open a rift back home, all I had to do was add it to the list of abilities I was attuned to.

Of course, it wasn't as easy as snapping my fingers and willing it to be done. If it was, I would have become an omnipotent god-king a long, long time ago. No, I had to be in the right mental and emotional state if I wanted to attune myself to a new ability. And right now, that meant closing my eyes, calming down, and letting go of my insecurities.

The simple ones came first. Though the army of clockwork demons outside was terrifying, the bunker we were in was secure. There was no need to fear for my physical safety. I felt a burden leave me as my breathing slowed. I was getting closer to attunement. I could feel it.

The harder ones came next. I'd been matching wits against an opponent that wanted nothing more than to steal the secret of attuning new powers, and they had thoroughly outmaneuvered me at every opportunity they had. They'd been the one to trap me here, after all.

But they'd made one crucial mistake, and that was trying to trap a person who could create their own powers on the fly. I would overcome my enemies. I would adapt, and I would get out of here alive.

Another insecurity faded, and I *felt* the attunement beginning to form. Like ink unfurling around my soul. There was one last anxiety, one darker and deeper than the rest, but I let it sleep. If all went well, I wouldn't need to go that far.

I opened my eyes, and was surprised to find that Tanryn had fallen asleep in the time I'd spent in meditation. With my new attunement, I could see currents of power bloom in her soul and mine, and I gathered that power into the palm of my hand.

Then I hurled it against the fabric of reality, and a rift began to claw itself open.

To the outside world, it would seem as though my power was to open rifts.

And only I knew better.
