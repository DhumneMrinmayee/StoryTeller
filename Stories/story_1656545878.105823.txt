It wasn’t the best of games. Certainly wasn’t the worst, looking at you Bloodborne. But I was pretty sure I had a chance. 

Sure, there was no toilet paper but It wasn’t  the first time I didn’t have any. (Looking at you 2020). There were gonna be monsters and demons and dragons. Bandits and giant spiders. Ogres along with blood mages. Still, could be Bloodborne. 

I always wanted to go on an adventure but I got rid of the Third Age when I was 15 and can’t save middle earth but Thedas was always my second choice. 

Inquisition was too much of a bore and II was always a let down but Origins was the greatest of them all. 

I selected the Human Noble origin. My favorite of all time. This time I decide to go by Aedan, figured if this was gonna be my new life. I’d go by the name the Couslands had picked. 

I took a deep breath and went into my closet. My fridge might be bare but my safe was still full. I grabbed the mossberg first. The range may have been limited but Bessie would do the job in the opening siege. 

Valerie and Linda were next, my AK and 1911. Classics but good ones. They’d help hold the main gate. I never did like leaving Gilmore to die. Dude was a bro until the end. 

I take all the ammo I can carry and load it into my backpack. It’s just over 500 rounds. Not much but enough for the prologue. Even if I don’t live to see the end of it. I can’t find it in me to leave the Couslands. They didn’t deserve what happened. None of them did.

Hopefully, I’ll be able to stop Amethyne from becoming an orphan. (I was always disappointed they never included a storyline for her character. Would’ve made the Alienage-slavers more intense.) 

Maybe this time, I’ll save them. If not, well, I can’t think of a better way to go than a blaze of glory. 

With Bessie in my hands, I take one last look at home and make my way to Highever. I’m coming Howe.
