2 silver, 85 copper. A fine leather toolbelt. A worn-out left-handed greatsword with only +2 attack left. Two iron daggers, one even with more than 50% condition! A firewand with no charges left and three empty soulstones. Finally 562 loafs of bread, 103 empty ale mugs, and his cherished fourteen copies of "Restoratoin Spells #01", which the Ring of Elders from the Magic Guild apparently hand-wrote with the same error in the title.

Other than the clothes on his back, it was all that was left of his shop. All that he had managed to stash in his backpack before it went down with the rest of the city in the Sandwyrm's final attack.

Why did those damn Protagonysts have to bring the beasts to HIS city for their arrogant, self-centered final battles, of all the cities in the great land of LÃ¯tmabong?

Now, the last Protagonyst had finally defeated the Ganjanic Sandwyrm and had been blessed with the Crown of Everstone by the High Princess. He had then abandoned everything without looking back. But meanwhile the city of Needahit was gone, including Jonko's old shop, and all that was left was this sorry excuse for an adventuring inventory.

So, there he stood. He hadn't had any magic training OR weapons training, and was trying to work out how to hold a dagger and a greatsword at the same time, but every time he picked one up, the other teleported to his back sheath or his toolbelt.

The night grew dark. From the immense crater behind him, he heard howls, grunts and moans. In front of him lay the Grateweed Forest, from which countless pairs of red eyes looked at him, challenging him to enter.

He had no choice. He set forth. At least he wouldn't be hungry any time soon.
