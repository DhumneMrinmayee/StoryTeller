"Well, let's talk about it for a second, shall we?"

The demon observed the human, as she pulled back, lowering her sword. He could end her with his mere touch, he could cause her sould to scream in agony before sending her to an eternity of torment. But he had to admit... he was amused. "GO ON", he said, his voice ripping a tear in the fabric of reality itself.

"So, thing is, I am no man, right?

"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT", said the eldritch horror, "I REFER TO 'MAN' AS IN A MEMBER OF HUMANITY. YOU ARE VERY FOOL", he concluded.

"Just follow me on that, okay? Do you know the great philosopher Matahammatah?"

"YES. I'VE USED HIM TO TORTURE THE SOUL OF THE DAMNED FOR CENTURIES NOW. NOONE CAN WITHSTAND HIM MORE THAN ONE HOUR WITHOUT LOSING ALL SEMBLANCE OF SANITY."

"Good, so you know he thought very badly about women, right? He stated that..."

"THAT WOMEN ARE INFERIOR BEINGS, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MERE BREED ANIMALS FOR MAN. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS."

"But I am! And I'm going to prove you he was right!"

The demon looked at the woman in front of him. She was tiny, in comparison, he could kill her by stomping on her with his hooves. He could make her burn and not die for years, just to amuse himself with her endless agony. He could make her part of her hide and feel her forever gasping for help and mercy, words stolen with her lungs. He could create all sort of tortures for that foolish female human, but still...

"ALRIGHT", he proclaimed. "IF YOU CAN HUMILIATE HALF OF YOUR RACE AND CONVINCE ME THAT HUMAN FEMALES ARE NOT TO BE CONSIDERED HUMAN, BUT MERE BREED ANIMALS, I SHALL ALLOW YOU TO SLAY ME."

"Good!" she said, and then turned to the speechless soldiers that watched that verbal exchange. "I need a white board, markers and a cup of tea! Would you like one, Asmodeus, Demolisher of Worlds, Creator of the Eternal Torment and Devourer of Souls?"

"YES" he answered, as he sat on the ground.

The debate lasted for hours. Every point held by that human female, which Asmodeus learned was called General Helena, was brilliantly countered by the demon. But still she persisted, twisting her arguments, rebating every single point made by the demon until, finally, he laid back looking at the human... impressed.

"SO, ACCORDING TO YOU, HUMAN FEMALES ARE BASICALLY... CATTLE. THEY ARE BORN TO SUFFER, TO BREED CHILDREN AND TO BE UNDER MALE RULE. IS THAT CORRECT?"

"Yes, it is"

"I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE MAKING YOU ALL A FAVOR IF I ENDED YOUR MISERABLE LIFES ONCE AND FOR ALL"

"But if you ended our suffering... you would not be considered the Creator of Eternal Torment, right? And plus, by accepting this, you will be accepting that all human females are basically animals, which means we have no souls for you to devour."

"I COULD DEMOLISH YOUR WORLD, STILL"

"What? And not be loyal to your own titles? I guess if you want to be mocked in all thirteen circles of hell, that would be acceptable..."

She crossed fingers behind her back. Asmodeus, Demolisher of Worlds, Creator of the Ethernal Torment and Devourer of Souls looked at her for the longest moment.

"I SHALL MEDITATE ABOUT THAT".

And, in a vortex of roaring fire and flames, so powerful that General Helena had to jump to the ground to avoid being devoured by that inferno, Asmodeus, Demolisher of Worlds, Creator of the Ethernal Torment and Devourer of Souls... left the material world.

"Holy hell... I can't believe this worked!"
