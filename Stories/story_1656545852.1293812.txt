"listen, I dont know what you're talking about but-"

"AH AH AH!" a monkey's yell from the basement cut me off, they're probably gonna write something that's gonna repeat all... *this*.

"**I do not care about what you believe is true or not MORTAL**" the being that seems to be made out of sunlight rebutted, "**YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD FROM GAZING AT MY TRUE FORM**" it added,

I raised my hands, "that I am, you can be sure of that but I swear it's the-"

"**last chance mortal! if you still act ignorant and blame these... unevolved homos as the ones who obtained information from beyond the rift you will be executed right here right** ***now*****.**" the being's voice turned cold at the end of his sentence,

"**do you think I am stupid mortal?**" after a while of not answering, the deity added. "**stating that these... monkeys! are the ones who obtained information regarding** ***gods?***"

I nodded, "yeah I mean-"

a spear of light held by a hand that grew out of the being's back phased through the air, damaging a part of my cheek and piecing the floor. Eyes appeared on the humanoid's face, they narrowed to finally show emotion,

"**I do not give this many chances, but you are useful.**" it said,

"LISTEN OKAY?! LISTEN I THINK YOU'RE GENUINELY MISTAKING SOMETHING HERE!" I raised my arms forward in hopes that it'll stop whatever this guy is gonna do next, "IT IS NOT ME!"

its eyes narrowed even further until they turned into slits, "**very well, I will give you the benefit of the doubt and I shall see what these primates do in order to get information about us, and if it is confirmed then I shall take them for myself."**

it started walking away, "**however mortal, I must warn you, if what you have said is a lie and instead what I will see is nothing but incoherent jibberish that should not belong in any language then-**"

a monkey burst out of the door at this moment, carrying a piece of paper. He passed the god and handed me the paper, a smile on its face, clearly wanting a reward.

I reached my hand out to a nearby basket, grabbed a banana, and handed to the monkey wwho happily went back inside.

"-**I will kill you.**" the god finished his sentence and grabbed the parchment handed to me, and his slits for eyes widened as he started to read through it,

"**hmmm...**"  a smile bloomed on its face as its eyes went back to me, "**it seems that you arent lying human,**" it stated,

the paper burned and the god reached a hand "**In courtesy and respect of you managing to train these lesser beings to do the things that they do, I shall buy them instead of taking them by force,**

"**shake it human, and I will gladly give you enough power that you will be able to turn your world upside down with but a flick of your wrist,"**

"wait what?" I muttered but before I could continue, the god went on-

"**a planet is such a small price to pay for beings capable of obtaining information about my own kin,**"

the smile that he had grew wider when I reached my hand out to grab his, an ugly chasm on his otherwise pristine yellow face.
