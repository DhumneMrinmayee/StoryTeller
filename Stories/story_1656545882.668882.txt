**"You know you can tell me anything, right?"** The Demon of Empathy sat across from me on a stuffed straw couch. Considering that they were an extradimensional entity, the form they chose was surprisingly human: barrel-chested, broad-shouldered, and even wearing a pair of thin-rimmed glasses that weren't there the last time we'd met.

I sat down on my own couch. It was irritating and ill-fitting, but that just meant it reminded me of home. I was pretty sure the Demon of Empathy had done that on purpose. "I *can* tell you anything," I countered. "Whether I *should* is another matter entirely."

The Demon of Empathy leaned forwards, steepling their fingers beneath their chin. "Are you afraid of hurting me?"

Of course a damn Demon of Empathy would see right through me. It was an irrational fear—I'd experienced the Demon of Empathy's power and wisdom firsthand, and to nobody's surprise, even the vilest of the dark thoughts that whispered in my ear were nothing compared to what the ancient entity knew. And yet still I shrugged and said, "I'd hurt anyone else if I talked about it." *Even myself,* I thought, although I tried not to let it show.

The Demon of Empathy raised a hand, and the scenery around us *blurred*. I'd gotten better at understanding the strange place that lived in my dreams where the demon and I had our talks. One of its rules, apparently, was that the Demon of Empathy could shift the appearance of our surroundings at a whim. We appeared on top of a clock tower, watching my past self moongaze, lying down next to a girl with dark brown hair that flowed in the wind.

"Other people have confided in you," the Demon of Empathy said. "Does it hurt *you* when they speak of the dark thoughts that hound them?"

I hesitated. "It... doesn't," I finally said.

"How would you describe how it makes you feel, then?"

I bit my lip. For some reason, it had simply... never occurred to me to even ask that question. "When Lucet told me about what... what her 'boyfriend' was doing to her..." I struggled to find the words. "It felt *right*. It felt like... like she was lancing a boil. Taking that toxicity out of her heart before its infection reached her marrow."

I was pretty sure that wasn't how infected wounds worked, but if the Demon of Empathy noticed, they didn't say a thing. Instead, they simply asked:

"Then if others giving voice to their inner demons doesn't hurt you, why do you think your inner demons would destroy them?"

From anyone else, I would have snapped at them and clammed up. But the Demon of Empathy knew how to sound genuinely curious instead of challenging, how to set up conversation after conversation so that it was *okay* for me to be wrong because that meant I could become *right*, and I whispered, "Because it's just me."

My therapist—and as twisted and darkly amusing as it was that a Demon of Empathy was the closest thing I had to a therapist, that was what they were—simply regarded me with a calm, open gaze, wordlessly asking if I wanted to continue.

"With Lucet, it was someone else hurting her. And we could both hate him for what he'd done. But with me..." I held up a shaking hand, trying to see it as it was *now*, not as it had been. "It's just me," I repeated. "I'm the only one responsible for what I've done to myself. The voices that whisper in my ear? They're all *my* voice. Nobody else's. Don't you get it? *I am the monster.* And if I tell Lucet... won't she hate the monster too?" My voice grew pleading, and the Demon of Empathy opened his arms, and rifts forgive me but I embraced the demon, breaking down in sobs.

"I, too, am a monster," the Demon of Empathy murmured. "I have committed atrocities that would make dark gods jealous, and over my many, many years, I have learned one thing."

The Demon of Empathy pulled back, and their gaze was fierce. "I am the monster, yes. But I am also a therapist, and a leader, and a friend. And if I can be all those at once, you can too."

And something in my mind *snapped*. I saw the Demon of Empathy for what they were—killer, savior, truth and lie, angel, demon, therapist, spy—and I saw myself in every facet of their being.

*If I can be all those at once, you can too.*

I sniffled and leaned back, the effort strange even after how much time I'd spent getting used to the dream-plane we met in. I felt its edges begin to fray as I started my return to consciousness.

"Same time tomorrow?" the Demon of Empathy asked.

I nodded mutely, too stunned to do anything else.

"I'll see you then," the demon said, just before the world dissolved.

I awoke in my bed, the echoes of tears clinging dry to my face.
