"...But you see how that is offensive right?"

"Yes, I'm sorry, I'm super sorry but I mean..."

"What? You mean what? is it the pink ears?"

"No, no... well I mean they don't help..."

"It's the super soft fur isn't it..."

"No no... I mean its very nice... it looks very soft..."

"I bet you don't even find my large, puppy dog eyes intimidating in the least do you?"

"I'm not sure I'd... use that word..."

"Great, fine. Let me ask you, how many doomsday Gods have *you* summoned?"

"I mean..."

"How many?"

"...none..."

"Exactly. You know how I know that? Because where are we standing?"

"... the... the world?"

"Correct, and what would *not* be here, had you summoned a world ending God before...?"

"... the... world?"

"Wow, perhaps you're not as blatantly incompetent as I had previously thought, now shall we get on with the ritual? Take my paw in your hand and repeat after me..."

"Perfect, now remove your right foot from the incantation circle!"

"Like this?"

"Excellent my minions! Now! Return your right foot to the incantation circle, and SHAKE IT WITH THE FORCE OF A THOUSAND EARTHQUAKES!"

"...the what now?"

"The hokey pokey, you're having us do the hokey pokey..."

"I've traveled across a thousand universes, through endless dimensions and ended billions upon billions of lives, and I haven't the damnedest idea what you are talking about. Can we please finish?!"

"My greatest apologies my lord! Please, continue!"

"Finally. *Anyhow,* before I was *rudely* interrupted..."

"We are ready my lord!"

"...Ok... so you put your left foot into the incantation circle..."
